### <a name="connect"></a>1. Connecting your Suite and Facebook accounts

 When you start with Social Ads, your first task is to log in to Facebook. First make sure that you are not logged in to any Facebook accounts, and then click **Connect with Facebook** to open the Facebook login dialog.

<table style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left; width: 80px; border-color: #fff; background-color: #fff; color: #eb5a19;">**Please Note:**</td> <td>You cannot change your Facebook Ads account after you have selected it, so make sure to select the right one. If you do select the wrong one (e.g. a test account), please contact Emarsys Support to change it.</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="row">[![connecting to facebook](/assets/images/connecting-to-facebook.png)](/assets/images/connecting-to-facebook.png)</div> After logging in, Suite will automatically display your Facebook Ads account and the currency it uses, as well as your fan pages.

### <a name="selectpage"></a>2. Selecting and removing your fan pages

 If you want to display ads on the Facebook News Feed, you must now select the fan pages to use as the destination links for those ads. These are then made available for selection in the Campaign editor. You can remove a fan page by clicking the **X **icon next to it.

### <a name="budget"></a>3. Setting your monthly budget

 The monthly budget you set will be used by Facebook when it bids for your adverts against those of your competitors (or the other companies competing for the same space). Facebook will spend this money according to its own algorithms, in order to get the best results from the campaigns you launch. Your Facebook Ads budget is hierarchical, that is, you have an overall budget for Facebook Ads, within this a maximum is defined for Emarsys Social Ads, and within this you can define a maximum spendÂ  per Social Ads campaign.
