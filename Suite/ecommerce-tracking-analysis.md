Ecommerce Tracking Analysis
---------------------------

 Once the feature is enabled the results of the eCommerce tracking are included in the **Results Summary** section of **Emails** in the **Analysis** menu. It gives a breakdown of the total revenue, number of buyers, number of orders, average revenue per order as well as number of abandoned shopping carts.

### Tracking Orders

 The **Orders** section provides an overview of all orders successfully placed, which can be filtered by date or email campaign. To get an itemized breakdown of what items were purchased in the order, simply click the zoom icon to the right of the shipping costs. Clicking this will take you to the items page with a filtered view only including items purchased as part of that order.

### Tracking Abandoned Shopping Carts

 The **Abandoned shopping carts** section lists instances where items have been placed in a shopping cart, but the purchase was not successfully completed within a certain timeframe (30 minutes). As with the **Orders** section you can get an itemized breakdown by clicking the zoom icon to the right of the shipping costs. The following scenarios are possible when a contact abandons a shopping cart:

- Contact arrives at the web shop from an Emarsys email.
- Contact arrives at the web shop via the browser, but has clicked an Emarsys email in the last 30 days (thus has a live cookie).
- Contact arrives at the web shop via browser but without a live cookie (this is available only with advanced ecommerce tracking).

 The **Items** page gives a breakdown of all individual items purchased, which can then be filtered by the email campaign that triggered the purchase. The columns here are defined by system fields and optional fields that are selected when integrating the standard ecommerce feature (optional fields: product code, product name, category, price and quantity).
