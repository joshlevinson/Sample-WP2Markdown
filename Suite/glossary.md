Here you can find a list of the terms that we use in the Suite interface and in the supporting documentation.

### Contact-related

<table class="wikitable"><thead><tr><th>Contacts</th> <td>They are your customers, the potential recipients of your emails.</td> </tr><tr><th>External ID (same as 'external key')</th> <td>External IDs are used to identify a contact in your database. To be able to map customers between an external database and Suite, the *external ID* is also stored in Suite. In case "external ID" is a real ID in your database meaning that it does not correspond to any of the system fields in Suite then a custom field has to be created for the external ID. This field should be called **externalId** (please note the capitalization), since many of the third-party applications with which Suite integrates look specifically for a field with this name.</td> </tr><tr><th>Field</th> <td>A property (i.e. key-value pair) of the contact. A field could be a - System field: This is predefined by eMarketing Suite
- Custom field: Defined by you
 
</td> </tr><tr><th>Field ID</th> <td>Since all fields are key-value-pairs, we need a key. Field IDs are the keys which allow you to get all fields via the API. You can find a full list the system field IDs [here](/Uncategorized/system-fields.md "Suite System Fields Reference").The Suite API works only with Field IDs and ignores field names. That means that if you delete a field and then recreate it with the same name, it will be given a new ID, and you will have to update any existing API calls accordingly.</td> </tr><tr><th>Key</th> <td>The field that is used to identify the contact in Suite. By default, this is the email address with field ID '3'. <table cellpadding="1" class="wikitable" style="width: 100%; border: 0px solid #999;"><tbody><tr><td scope="col" style="text-align: left; border: 0px solid #999; vertical-align: top;" width="60px">[![Icon AdditionalInfo.png](/assets/images/Icon_AdditionalInfo.png)](/assets/images/Icon_AdditionalInfo.png)</td> <td scope="col" style="border: 0px solid #999; vertical-align: top; color: #555555;">Key is used for duplication handling. *External ID* and *key* can be the same, but don't have to be.</td> </tr></tbody></table></td> </tr><tr><th>Source</th> <td>This field in Suite indicates how and where a contact was created in your system. You can use it to export all registrations from a particular source, for example, or to compare two sources.</td></tr></thead></table>### Content-related

<table class="wikitable"><thead><tr><th>Batch email</th> <td>An email sent to a group of contacts, which is defined by a *segment* or a *contact list*.</td> </tr><tr><th>Email</th> <td>The content you want to send to your recipients. You can create emails using the Suite UI, but also via the API. Since the API does not allow you to use all features (e.g. templates), it is easiest if you use the API to trigger emails created in the Suite UI.</td> </tr><tr><th>External event</th> <td>This is a named event that triggers an email to be sent. External events always include references to the contact the email will be sent to. Therefore, you can use *external events* to send transactional emails.</td> </tr><tr><th>Program</th> <td>A program is a series of actions, starting from an entry point (ie. a trigger) and progressing along a decision tree until an end point. There are different types of programs. From the API you can trigger so-called transactional programs. For more about programs, see the eMarketing Suite Online Help.</td> </tr><tr><th>Transactional email</th> <td>An email triggered by an external event. It is sent to the contact included in the external event.</td></tr></thead></table>### Contact list-related

<table class="wikitable"><thead><tr><th>Contact List</th> <td>A *static* group of contacts. After its definition, the list will not change, unless you change it intentionally.Contact lists can be created by - saving imported contacts into a contact list
- using the API.
- saving a segment into a contact list, to make it static
 
</td> </tr><tr><th>Segment</th> <td>A *dynamically* generated group of contacts. A segment is generated by a **filter**. Each time the segment is used the filter runs and the segment's contacts are updated.</td></tr></thead></table>
