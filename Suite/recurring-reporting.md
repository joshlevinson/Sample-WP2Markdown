Recurring Campaign Reporting
============================

 **Analysis** menu ->** Emails ** The analysis page for the parent email of a recurring campaign shows you the responses to all the child emails of that campaign in a given time period, giving you an insight into changes in the performance of this campaign over time. Note: If you select the analysis of a child email, you will be shown the total responses for that email only, as for other ad hoc campaigns. [column width="eight" place="first" ] On this page you can: 1. [Select the time range you want to cover](#timerange)
2. [View an aggregated summary of the whole campaign](#aggregated)
3. [Select the metrics you want to study](#selectmetrics)
4. [View a detailed summary of each child campaign](#summary)
5. [Export the results as a .CSV file](#export)

 Use the control in the top left corner to select from a series of preset timeframes (last 7 days, last 30 days, last 60 days, etc.) or define your own range. The time range refers to the date when the email was **launched**, not when it was opened or clicked. In other words, all responses, no matter when they occurred, will be displayed for each selected email. For a detailed analysis of when each response came for each email, please check the **Individual Link Tracking** for that email. <a name="aggregated"></a>### 2. View an aggregated summary of the selected campaigns

 The upper part of the analysis shows you the total figures for all selected emails, as well as the overall response rates. <a name="selectmetrics"></a>### 3. Select the metrics you want to study

 The legend on the right of the screen shows the available metrics. Activating each one will show that metric on the chart, in the appropriate color. <a name="summary"></a>### 4. View a detailed summary of each campaign

 For each of the child emails on the graph, you can: - Hover your mouse cursor over them to see the selected response metrics for that email.
- Click the email to display a full list of all responses
- On this pop-up, click **View Email** to see the email content, or
- Click **View Report** to open the **Results Summary** page for that email
 
<a name="export"></a>### 5. Export the results as a .CSV file

 You can also export the selected analysis in a .CSV file via the button on the top right of the page.
