In the Section Editor, you can define the preferences for the actual content of the email. If you are using the A/B testing feature, these settings will apply only to the open version. In this way you can test different subject lines, headers, etc.

### Sender Information

 The content you enter here is what your contacts will first see when they receive your email, and should be selected with care as it can have a major impact on deliverability. In particular the **From (email address)** is important, as most ISPs will not forward emails without a reply address. <table cellpadding="1" class="wikitable" style="width: 100%; border: 1px solid #fff;"><tbody><tr><td scope="col" style="text-align: left; border: 1px solid #fff; vertical-align: top;" width="60px">![Icon FurtherReading.png](/assets/images/Icon_FurtherReading.png)</td> <td scope="col" style="border: 1px solid #fff;">For more information on best practices for optimizing your email deliverability, please see the Deliverability Policy and Guidelines documentation in the Appendix of the *Suite Online Help*.</td></tr></tbody></table>### Additional features
