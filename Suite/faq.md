Social Ads takes this functionality and seamlessly integrates it into the Suite platform, meaning you can:

- Use the sophisticated segmentation of Suite (customer lifecycle stages, email responses, purchase and browse history, etc.) to create highly specific micro-segments
- Create your ads and audiences within Suite, ensuring consistent messaging across all channels
- Use the Automation Center to add Facebook to your automated engagement campaigns, adding contacts to audiences in real time based on their behavior, and removing them again afterwards
- Improve your ROAS (Return On Ad Spend) by only targeting contacts at specific times, and for shorter durations, with highly personalized content matching their customer lifecycle stage at precisely that moment
 
 What this means is that Social Ads takes the basic premise of Facebook Custom Audiences - locate your customers on Facebook and engage with them there - and turns this into real-time, 1-to-1 targeting.<a name="shared"></a></td> </tr></tbody><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left;">**Are email addresses shared with Facebook?**</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left; border-color: #fff; background-color: #fff; color: #555555;">No. The email addresses are hashed before sending the audience to Facebook via API. Facebook has documented privacy and information security practices related to Custom Audiences, which you can read here: <https://www.facebook.com/ads/manage/customaudiences/tos.php><a name="lookalike"></a></td> </tr></tbody><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left;">**Are my Lookalike Audiences comprised exclusively of new leads and prospects?**</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left; border-color: #fff; background-color: #fff; color: #555555;">Not necessarily. Facebook does automatically exclude the users in the source audience, but it does not check to see if the users it selects for the lookalike audience are already in your database (or indeed in another custom audience). Therefore it is possible that some existing contacts will also appear in lookalike audiences. To avoid this, you will have to launch the Ads campaign from within Facebook and there explicitly exclude all your other audiences.<a name="how-many"></a></td> </tr></tbody><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left;">**How many audiences and campaigns can I create through Suite?**</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left; border-color: #fff; background-color: #fff; color: #555555;">You can create as many audiences and campaigns as you like. However:

- Your audiences are restricted only by Facebook's threshold of 20 members before they can be targeted
- Your active campaigns are limited only by how far your Social Ads budget will stretch<a name="cap"></a>
 
</td> </tr></tbody><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left;">**How can I control how many of my ads will Facebook users see?**</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left; border-color: #fff; background-color: #fff; color: #555555;">There is currently no capping functionality available within Suite, but Facebook restricts the **Newsfeed ads **(desktop and mobile) to 2-3 impressions per user, per day. Therefore if you exclude **Right-side ads** from your campaign, you will automatically have this default capping in place. If you include Right-side ads, you cannot control how many ads the users will see in total. <a name="remove"></a></td> </tr></tbody><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left;">**When and why should I remove contacts from audiences?**</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left; border-color: #fff; background-color: #fff; color: #555555;">The more relevant a Facebook ad is, the stronger the impact it will have. If you add a contact to an audience straight after an interaction with your website, your brand will still be fresh in their mind for a day or two, so a well-placed ad will have a high chance of click through. Keeping the ad for longer will bring diminshing chances of respone and oinly eat away at your budget. Better to remove the contact and save theÂ  <a name="a/b"></a></td> </tr></tbody><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left;">**How can I control the A/B testing of my ad campaigns?**</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left; border-color: #fff; background-color: #fff; color: #555555;">You can't. Once you have created a version of an ad and launched the campaign, Facebook uses its own testing algorithms to identify the best-performing ad and will make sure that this reaches the most users. You can follow the progress on the Campaign Reporting page.<a name="how-often"></a></td> </tr></tbody><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left;">**How often can audiences be refreshed?**</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left; border-color: #fff; background-color: #fff; color: #555555;">It can take Facebook up to one hour to match an audience once it has received a request (though this usually happens much faster). Emarsys sends Facebook updates: - In real time, if a contact is added to an audience through the Automation Center
- Every 15 minutes, if the **Keep your audience synchronized** option is enabled<a name="cost"></a>
 
</td> </tr></tbody><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left;">**Is the cost of media included in the Social Ads product, and how much should I budget?**</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left; border-color: #fff; background-color: #fff; color: #555555;">The cost of media is not included and billed separately by Facebook. Your Facebook account will connect to Suite with your credit line. The minimum budget will depend on your use case and the amount of contacts you are expecting to target, but given that you are limiting targeting to just your own customers, the media budgets are relatively small.<a name="existing"></a>

 </td> </tr></tbody><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left;">**How do I use my existing Facebook Ads account with Social Ads?**</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left; border-color: #fff; background-color: #fff; color: #555555;">You will authorize the Social Ads app to access your existing Facebook Ads account to create and manage audiences on your behalf. Billing is handled directly between you and Facebook.<a name="accounts"></a>
