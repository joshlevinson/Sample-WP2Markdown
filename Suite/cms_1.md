eMarketing Suite offers an advanced and intuitive content management system (CMS) which, when used in conjunction with email templates, offers a quick and reliable way to create complex and sophisticated email campaigns with little effort. The email templates are built to your specifications by the Emarsys Web Development team and can easily be filled with content, either manually or automatically via RSS feed, and launched. For details on what aspects of your email to consider when preparing your email template design, please see the page on [CMS Template Requirements](/Suite/template-requirements.md "CMS Template Requirements"). If you require any further information on Suite templates, please speak to Emarsys Support. If you prefer to create email campaigns based on your own HTML code, or if you use an agency to prepare your creatives for you, please read our [Guidelines for HTML Emails](/Suite/html-guidelines.md "Guidelines for HTML Email"). For information on how to create emails in Suite using your own HTML code, please refer to the *Suite Online Help*. Learn more about the Suite CMS:
