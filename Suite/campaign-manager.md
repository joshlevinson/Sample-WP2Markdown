Email campaigns are created in Suite using the Email Campaign Manager, which is accessed via the **Campaigns** menu. The **Overview** page lists all the email campaigns created in your account. The filter options above the list enable you to sort the list according to your specifications. You can also search for individual email campaigns using the **Search** function on the left of the screen. For more information on the information and controls on this page, please refer to the *Suite Online Help*.

 You can create a new email either using a blank template, or by copying an existing campaign.

- If you copy an existing campaign, you will copy everything from the content to the settings and scheduling options.
- If you create a new email from a blank template you will first be asked to choose the template.

 After creating the email, you enter the Suite content management system, which is comprised of the Toolbar, Section Editor and Live Preview pane.

 Here you save your work, and can find all the controls you need to configure the high-level settings of your email campaign, including testing utilities and scheduling.

 Here you can see all the section groups in your email template, and is where you add and modify the actual content of your email.

#### <span class="mw-headline" id="3711a4b9a057b214786c91d27d453213">Live Preview (3)<a name="bs-ue-jumpmark-015b9f73c08cbd2afb5ba28f97981e6b"></a></span>

 This pane displays the content you add to your email and refreshes dynamically, helping you to visualise the final layout of the email as you work. The section that you select in the section editor is highlighted in the preview; you can also scroll up and down in the preview to select a section and this will then open in the section editor.

 When you save your changes, Suite displays a validation message which lists all the settings which still need to be defined before the email campaign can be launched.
