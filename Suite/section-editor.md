The Section Editor**Campaigns**
-------------------------------

 menu -> **Email Campaigns** -> **Section Editor** The Sections pane shows all the available section groups in your chosen template, and lists the groups in the order in which they would appear in the email. The order of these groups cannot be changed; however, the order of sections within a group can be changed by dragging and dropping the sections. The section list has the following controls:

<table border="0" class="wikitable"><tbody><tr><td>[![Suite CMS End-user Guide - English Page 07 Image 0002.png](/assets/images/Suite_CMS_End-user_Guide_-_English_Page_07_Image_0002.png)](/assets/images/Suite_CMS_End-user_Guide_-_English_Page_07_Image_0002.png)</td> <td>Add a section to the group.</td> </tr><tr><td scope="col" style="vertical-align: top;" width="20px">[![Suite CMS End-user Guide - English Page 07 Image 0003.png](/assets/images/Suite_CMS_End-user_Guide_-_English_Page_07_Image_0003.png)](/assets/images/Suite_CMS_End-user_Guide_-_English_Page_07_Image_0003.png)/[![Suite CMS End-user Guide - English Page 07 Image 0004.png](/assets/images/Suite_CMS_End-user_Guide_-_English_Page_07_Image_0004.png)](/assets/images/Suite_CMS_End-user_Guide_-_English_Page_07_Image_0004.png)</td> <td>If your template is enabled for Mobile Sense, these icons indicate whether or not this section will display on both mobile and desktop clients or will be hidden for mobile clients and display only on desktop.</td> </tr><tr><td>[![Suite CMS End-user Guide - English Page 07 Image 0007.png](/assets/images/Suite_CMS_End-user_Guide_-_English_Page_07_Image_0007.png)](/assets/images/Suite_CMS_End-user_Guide_-_English_Page_07_Image_0007.png)</td> <td>Copy the section.</td> </tr><tr><td>[![Suite CMS End-user Guide - English Page 07 Image 0008.png](/assets/images/Suite_CMS_End-user_Guide_-_English_Page_07_Image_0008.png)](/assets/images/Suite_CMS_End-user_Guide_-_English_Page_07_Image_0008.png)</td> <td>Delete the section.</td> </tr><tr><td>[![Suite CMS End-user Guide - English Page 07 Image 0009.png](/assets/images/Suite_CMS_End-user_Guide_-_English_Page_07_Image_0009.png)](/assets/images/Suite_CMS_End-user_Guide_-_English_Page_07_Image_0009.png)</td> <td>Click and hold this icon to drag a section within a group.</td></tr></tbody></table> To open a section for editing, click anywhere on the section title bar.

### The Section Editor

 Section content can be edited in two modes: Standard and Advanced. Standard Mode is a fast and efficient way of adding content, since the formatting and layout are taken care of by the template. If you want to deviate from the template design, you can switch to Advanced Mode and use the HTML editor to work directly in the HTML code.

#### Working in Standard Mode

 A section consists of four main elements: header, body text, image and link. Each one can be opened via the menu on the left.

- **Header & Body** These are plain text fields which have a toolbar with limited formatting options. You can also switch between WYSIWYG and the HTML source code.
 
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" class="wikitable" style="width: 100%; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;"><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left; border-color: #fff; background-color: #fff; color: #eb5a19;">**Please Note:**</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left; border-color: #fff; background-color: #fff; color: #555555;">The HTML editor accepts only a limited set of HTML tags and will strip unsupported tags out when switching back to WYSIWYG mode. These tags should satisfy all but the most advanced editing requirements and a full list can be found in the *Suite Online Help*.</td></tr></tbody></table>- **Image** You can upload images from your Media Database or link to externally-hosted images by entering a URL. If your template is enabled for Mobile Sense, you can also define another image to display on mobile devices (otherwise the main image will be resized and displayed).
 
<table cellpadding="1" class="wikitable" style="width: 100%; border: 1px solid #fff;"><tbody><tr><td scope="col" style="text-align: left; border: 1px solid #fff;" width="60px">![Icon FurtherReading.png](/assets/images/Icon_FurtherReading.png)</td> <td scope="col" style="border: 1px solid #fff;">For more information on Mobile Sense, please refer to the *Mobile Sense End-user Guide*.</td></tr></tbody></table>- **Links** Here you enter the link for the section, and define whether the section header and image are also linked.

 In addition to these elements, there are other features available in the section editor.

- **Registration form** Here you can add a link to a form in the section.
- **Advanced options** Here you can move the section to another group, and also switch to edit the section in Advanced Mode.
- Section targeting If you want the section to appear only to contacts in a particular segment, use this option. The option Enable this section for network sharing should be used when you want to control which content is shared on a network. If this is activated, only this section, and no other sections in the group, can be shared on a network. If section targeting is enabled, this icon will appear in the sections list: [![Suite CMS End-user Guide - English Page 08 Image 0003.png](/assets/images/Suite_CMS_End-user_Guide_-_English_Page_08_Image_0003.png)](/assets/images/Suite_CMS_End-user_Guide_-_English_Page_08_Image_0003.png)
- **Social networks** Here you enable a section to be shared and also select which network icons to add to the section.
