How to Encode an Import File to UTF-8
=====================================

 Suite requires all contact data to be encoded in UTF-8. If you try to import a file which uses another encoding, the import will not be successful. To encode a .CSV file in UTF-8, proceed as follows:

1. Locate the file you want to import and, using the mouse right-click menu option **Open with**, open it using Notepad. [![save_to_utf8_1](/assets/images/save_to_utf8_1-1024x207.png)](/assets/images/save_to_utf8_1.png)
2. In Notepad, open the **File** menu, **Save as**, and select ***UTF-8 *** from the **Encoding** options. Make sure that the **Save as type** field is set to ***All Files (*.*)***. [![save_to_utf8_2](/assets/images/save_to_utf8_2.png)](/assets/images/save_to_utf8_2.png)
3. Your file will now be saved using UTF-8 encoding and you can continue with the import.
