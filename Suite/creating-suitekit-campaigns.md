When you create a campaign, the first page you see is the **Campaign Settings** page:

<div class="row">[![create campaign](/assets/images/create-campaign.png)](/assets/images/create-campaign.png)</div><table style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><th style="text-align: left; width: 80px; border-color: #fff; background-color: #fff; color: #eb5a19;">**Please Note:**</th> <td>This is also the page you open when you click the edit icon in the campaigns list.</td></tr></tbody></table> Here you must define the following:

- **Campaign name**
- **Objective** - this tells Facebook what you want to achieve with this campaign and is referenced by some of the algorithms it uses, for example for the bidding policy.Â  The options are: - Clicks to website - this is purely to drive traffic to your website<span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span>
- Website conversions - this tells Facebook that a [tracking pixel](/Suite/tracking-pixels.md "Social Ads â&#128;&#147; Tracking Pixels") has been added to the target web page, and will optimize the campaign according to the pixel category.
 
<table style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><th style="text-align: left; width: 80px; border-color: #fff; background-color: #fff; color: #eb5a19;">**Please Note:**</th> <td>You cannot change the campaign objective once you have saved the campaign. To do this, you must copy the campaign, change the objective and save it under a new name.</td> </tr></tbody></table>
- **Audience**
- **Budget** - this can be a daily or a lifetime budget for this campaign only, and is expressed in the currency of your Facebook Ads account
- **Schedule** - this defines when the campaign begins and ends. If you define no end date, it will run indefinitely.
- ****Bidding**** - this tells Facebook how to bid for your audience. You can choose between: - **Optimize for clicks** - Facebook will spend your budget more carefully on users who are most likely to click
- **Optimize for impressions** - Facebook will use your budget to reach as many users as possible
- **Ad position** - Facebook can display your ad in three areas of the Facebook page: - Desktop News Feed
- Mobile News Feeds
- Right Column
