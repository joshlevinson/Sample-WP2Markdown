In this section you can see where Mobile Sense appears in the Suite UI and what controls are available to you to fine-tune your emailâ&#128;&#153;s mobile display.

### Show / Hide Sections

 You don't always want to show all your content sections on a mobile device. Use the icons in the section list to toggle the content on and off for mobile display:

<table style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 80px;">[![toggle-mobile](/assets/images/toggle-mobile.png)](/assets/images/toggle-mobile.png)</td> <td style="vertical-align: middle;">These sections will be displayed on desktop <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> mobile devices.</td> </tr><tr><td>[![toggle-desktop-only](/assets/images/toggle-desktop-only.png)](/assets/images/toggle-desktop-only.png)</td> <td style="vertical-align: middle;">These sections will be displayed on desktop devices, but hidden for mobile devices.</td></tr></tbody></table>### Show / Hide Images

 If you choose to display a section on mobile devices, you can then decide whether you want to how the section image for mobiles, or upload a different image (e.g. one that has been redesigned in a more vertical format). This is done via these controls in the **Image** tab of the section editor:

<div class="row">[![mobile-sense-section-image](/assets/images/mobile-sense-section-image.png)](/assets/images/mobile-sense-section-image.png)</div> Here are a few reasons why dedicated mobile images may be beneficial:

- You can show dedicated mobile content such as â&#128;&#156;download our app from the appstoreâ&#128;&#157; image, only to the mobile users.
- You may wish to upload an image that is smaller in terms of KB to make it easier for some mobile clients to render and handle
- You might want to play with different proportions of the image to optimize real-estate on the mobile; for example, make the banner image taller and with bigger fonts.

### Live Preview

 As you build your responsive email you will want to preview both the desktop and the mobile version, so you can see the mobile design and review the content modifications you have made for the mobile version. A Mobile Sense powered template has an additional mobile tab in the preview screen so you can toggle the preview between desktop and mobile.

### Additional best practices for mobile content

 In addition to hiding sections or images to make the content more focused, there are a number of recommendations that we would make in terms of usability:

- **Navigation bar**

If the Navigation bar is programmed as a section, it should be hidden for mobile users - they don't need it.

- **If you canâ&#128;&#153;t seeâ&#128;¦Pre-header**

â&#128;&#156;If you canâ&#128;&#153;t see this email click hereâ&#128;¦â&#128;&#157; You don't really want this line of text to take your best 20% of screen real estate, and this rather defeats the object of Mobile Sense, so your responsive design should remove this sentence for mobiles readers (iPhones will anyway download all the images by default so this sentence is unnecessary for them). Other smartphone users should already know where to press to download the images in an email instead of having to go online.

However, when using a pre-header that has a summary or a call to action, it is highly recommended **not** to hide it for mobile users.

- **Remove â&#128;&#152;Decorativeâ&#128;&#153; images**

For desktop users, an image is sometimes just a nice decoration to compliment a paragraph, but for mobile content small images donâ&#128;&#153;t work. If you decide to put an image in there for a mobile user it should cover the entire screen. Therefore if it is just for decoration or to fill a space, then remember that text and calls to action are more important.

- **Mobile-optimized landing pages**

Now that you can send a responsive email that is optimized both for desktops and for mobiles, you will undoubtedly get better click-through-rates. But in order to get better conversions, donâ&#128;&#153;t forget to make a mobile landing page on your website, or better yet a fully responsive website, so that your mobile web content matches your high-quality mobile mail content. Your web provider should be able to help you achieve this.
