### Using Advanced Ecommerce Tracking in Suite

 Due to the way that the advanced tracking works, you do not see extra screens in Suite compared to the standard tracking. The main purpose is to enrich the contact database and allow for segmentation based on activity. Segments derived from advanced tracking are available to use in programs in the Automation Center, for example, working with your contactsâ€™ online shopping habits and triggering programs to run based on them. Using advanced ecommerce tracking allows you to start enriching the data you hold on contacts through their behavior on your web shop, which then translates to precision segmentation for future campaigns. Not only can you isolate trends using standard reporting, but you now have the ability to apply that information to segment contacts for future campaign targeting. Advanced eCommerce tracking is the natural progression from standard ecommerce tracking because in addition to capturing data from users who arrived at the web shop from an email campaign, it also captures data from other users who complete purchases and adds them to the contact database. Through custom logic and rules, advanced ecommerce tracking can be used to update and enrich contact profiles based on their web shop behavior. Server-side integrations result in easy HTTPS tracking requests, and allows for including and tracking of new contacts that have not had previous campaigns sent to them. #### Examples of programs using advanced ecommerce tracking
