Before you launch your email campaign, you should test it to ensure that all the content is being displayed correctly. There are three testing utilities available:

- **Show Full Preview** Whereas the Live Preview shows the content of the email without any personalisation or conditional content, this generates a full version of the actual email that will be sent and uses the Suite dummy contact to populate some (though not all) of the personalisation fields with values. The Full Preview also shows how the email will look in the text and mobile versions (when enabled).
- **Inbox Preview** Here you can see what your campaign will look like in the most popular email and webmail clients. In order to run a proper inbox preview test, the email must be ready to launch.
- **Send Testmail** You can send a testmail either to an email address that you enter manually, or to a Suite list or segment. If you enter the email address manually you will send an HTML and test version of the email, but without any personalisation. If you send a full campaign email to a list or segment, the email will be personalised for each recipient according to their contact properties.
