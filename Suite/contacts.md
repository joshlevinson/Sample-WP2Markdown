There are a number of ways you can add new registrations to Suite.

#### 1. Registration forms

 Suite has a simple, intuitive Forms Editor where you can create registration forms; no specialized technical or HTML knowledge is required. Then you can either:

- link to them directly from your website
- export the HTML code and embed them directly in your website

 If you have a corporate Facebook account, you can also embed Suite forms directly in one of your pages.

#### 2. Manual and automated imports

 You can also import entire contact lists into your Suite database, either manually or automatically via the auto-import feature.

#### 3. Using the Suite API to integration with existing forms

 If you have development resources available, the Suite API is the fastest and most efficient way to use your existing registration forms to import contacts directly into the Suite database. Please direct your technical support staff to the [Suite API Documentation](http://dev.emarsys.com) and the use case on [Updating Contacts](/Getting%20Started/update-contacts.md "API Use Case 5: Keeping contacts up to date").

#### 4. Using HTTP feeds

 If you are not using the Suite API, but do have some technical understanding, you can use the Suite Forms Editor to set up HTTP feeds to collect registrations and pass them to Suite. This document will explain how this works:
