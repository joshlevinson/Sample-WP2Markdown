 [/column] [column width="four" place="second" ] But first, why not take a quick tour: [embed width="600" height="150"]https://vimeo.com/111724006[/embed] [/column] <a name="timerange"></a>### 1. Selecting the time range

 Use the control in the top left corner to select from a series of preset timeframes (last 7 days, last 30 days, last 60 days, etc.) or define your own range. The time range refers to the date when the email was **launched**, not when it was opened or clicked. In other words, all responses, no matter when they occurred, will be displayed for each selected email. For a detailed analysis of when each response came for each email, please check the **Individual Link Tracking** for that email. Once you have defined the time range, the email selection will display all the campaigns sent during this period. <a name="selectcampaign"></a>### 2. Selecting the campaigns you want to analyze

 To select emails for the trend analysis, first filter the list to include the emails you want and then use the checkboxes to select the individual emails. Once you have selected an email, you can sort the list again without losing that selection. In this way you can analyze multiple emails of different types and from different categories. Filter the list by: - Choosing between the campaign type (Ad hoc, on-event or recurring)
- Using the dynamic search field to enter all or part of the email name
- Selecting the campaign category
 
 To remove all filters and display all emails available for the time range, click **Clear All Filters**. Select the emails by: - Manually activating the check boxes
- Using the **Select all**/**Deselect all** buttons (note that these work only on the emails that are currently displayed, not on emails that were previously selected).
 
 To see all the emails that you have selected, click **Display All Selected**. You can then click **Deselect All** to clear your selection completely. Click **Apply** to save your selection and refresh the analysis. <a name="aggregated"></a>### 3. View an aggregated summary of the selected campaigns

 The upper part of the analysis shows you the total figures for all selected emails, as well as the overall response rates. <a name="selectmetrics"></a>### 4. Select the metrics you want to study

 The legend on the right of the screen shows the available metrics. Activating each one will add that metric to the chart and the table. You can also toggle between the total response figures and the response rate in %. <a name="summary"></a>### 5. View a detailed summary of each campaign

 For each of the emails on the graph, you can: - Hover your mouse cursor over them to see the selected response metrics for that email.
- Click the email to display a full list of all responses
- On this pop-up, click **View Email** to see the email content, or
- Click **View Report** to open the **Results Summary** page for that email

### <a name="export"></a>6. Export the results

 The **Publish** button offers you two export formats for the current analysis: - Export the pure response data as a .CSV file
- Export the entire page in graphic form as a .PDF file
