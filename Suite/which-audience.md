Using Blank Audiences
=====================

 Blank audiences are the easiest and most flexible way to use Facebook as part of a multi-channel customer engagement strategy. Because you can dynamically add and remove contacts from the audience via the respective Automation Center nodes, you can define exactly the window of opportunity for your highly targeted ads campaigns, ensuring that your social ads budget is spent in the most effective way possible. Below are some example of how to use blank audiences.<a name="clc"></a>

#### Customer lifecycle marketing on Facebook

 In this image you can see three straightforward customer lifecycle programs that use Social Ads to target customers on Facebook.

<div class="row">[![Facebook-ads-campaigns](/assets/images/Facebook-ads-campaigns.png)](/assets/images/Facebook-ads-campaigns.png)</div>1. In the first program, all new contacts in the Suite database are automatically added to a Lead Nurturing audience. For the next three days they can be carefully targeted with incentives aimed at securing that first purchase. After the third day, if they haven't already converted they probably won't, so they are removed from the audience, keeping the audience compact and relevant and ensuring that you don't use up too much of the budget for that campaign on any one lead.
2. In the second program, one a first purchase has been recorded in the database, Suite removes the contact from the **Lead Nurturing** audience and adds them to the **1st-time Buyers** audience, where they can be introduced to loyalty schemes, or simply welcomed as a new customer. Again, after three days they are removed from the audience.
3. In the third program, a filter checks every day for new contacts who fit your profile for churning customers (for example, as defined in your Smart Insight ERFM scoring model). After adding them to the reactivation audience, you can target them with incentives aimed at winning them back.
 
<a name="multi"></a>#### Multi-channel engagement campaigns

 In this image you can see how a program can engage with new customers on three different channels, all triggered by a new contact entry in the Suite database. In this way you can take advantage of the strengths of each channel to send carefully targeted information and start your customer journey on the right foot.

 In this image, a one-off promotional email campaign is followed up on Facebook according to the behavior of the recipients.

<div class="row">[![social-ads-follow-email](/assets/images/social-ads-follow-email.png)](/assets/images/social-ads-follow-email.png)</div>- Contacts who failed to respond at all are added to an audience which can be targeted with the same content as the email
- Contacts who clicked on a link in the *Menswear* section of the email are added to an audience which is targeted with offers in this category
- Contacts who clicked on a link in the *Ladies Shoes* section of the email are added to an audience which is targeted with offers in this category
 
<a name="a/b"></a>#### A/B testing for Facebook Ads campaigns

 In this image, you can see how easy it is to validate the benefits of a multi-channel approach.

<div class="row">[![social-a-b-test](/assets/images/social-a-b-test.png)](/assets/images/social-a-b-test.png)</div> By keeping 10% of your first-time buyers in a control group targeted with email only, you can compare their conversion results with the rest of the contacts who are targeted with a mix of email and social ads.

Using Custom Audiences Based on Segments
========================================

 When you base a custom audiences on one of your existing Suite segments, all contacts in the source segment whose email address matches a Facebook profile are automatically added to the audience. You can then select whether to keep this audience static, or update it dynamically as the source segment changes.<a name="cart"></a>

#### Abandoned cart campaigns

 A good example of a social ads campaign based on a segment is a follow-up for abandoned shopping carts. Whichever way you track your abandoned carts, either using Suite's own segments, via Smart Insight or through your own API calls, you can define a segment in Suite that contains, say, every contact who abandoned a cart in the last day. The audience will include these customers for only a short period (e.g. 24 hours) from the moment they abandoned the cart and target them with a campaign designed to push them to complete their purchase.<a name="brand"></a>

#### Brand awareness campaigns

 You don't always want to use a marketing campaign to sell products. Especially on social media, brand awareness campaigns are often better received and more successful than more commercially-oriented ones. For example, by segmenting for contacts who have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">responded to an email</span> or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">visited your website in the last three days</span>, you can keep a Facebook audience permanently filled with 'hot' contacts. After no interaction for three days they are no longer in the source segment and therefore (as long as the synchronization is active) removed from the audience.<a name="batch"></a>

#### One-off, batch campaigns

 If you want to run a one-off social ads campaign you can create an audience from a segment and ignore the sync option. This way you can guarantee that you will target those contacts, and only those contacts, for the duration of the campaign. Examples of such social ads campaigns could be reactivation of inactive customers, seasonal offers or 'back in stock' campaigns, or a follow-up for everyone who showed an interest in a recent promotion.<a name="lookalike"></a>

Lookalike audiences
===================

 Lookalike audiences are created by Facebook based on an audience that you created (usually comprising your best customers), which Facebook uses to find other users with similar attributes. This is a great and very cost-effective way to acquire valuable new leads. Please note that lookalike audiences are static, not dynamic. That is, they are created once, from the combined characteristics of the contacts in an audience at that moment, and are not updated afterwards.<a name="platinum"></a>

#### Finding new 'platinum' leads

 Your best customers all share some characteristics in common: high spenders with an affinity with your brand, a desire for your products, and the will to spend with you rather than your competitors. Create a segment from your most lucrative contacts and Facebook will fill a lookalike audience with similar people. Target them with selected offers and watch them convert to high-value customers.<a name="promo"></a>

#### Expand the reach of a promotional campaign

 You know (or should know!) which of your contacts are most likely to react well to a particular promotional offer. So why not create an audience from them and extend this offer to their lookalikes? Or make an audience from the contacts who reacted well to a particular campaign and use the lookalike audience to find more of the same type of customer.
