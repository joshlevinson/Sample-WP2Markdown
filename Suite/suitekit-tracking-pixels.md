Tracking Pixels**Campaigns**
============================

 menu ->** Social Ads** -> **Tracking Pixels ** If you want to select **Website Conversions** as your [campaign objective](/Suite/create-campaign.md "Creating Social Ads Campaigns"), you will need to add a Social Ads tracking pixel to the destination page for the ad. This pixel will help you to track activity and conversions on this page, as well as define the objectives against which you will measure the success of the Social Ads campaign that is targeting it. After you have created a tracking pixel, you can associate it with a campaign by selecting it from the drop-down that appears in the campaign editor. In most cases you would only add one pixel per web page, but you can use this pixel for multiple campaigns. After you activate a campaign which references a pixel, Facebook will automatically validate it for you. On this page you can:

- [Create a new tracking pixel](#new)
- [View your tracking pixels](#view)
- [View the tracking pixel code](#view-code)
- [Edit the tracking pixel settings](#edit)
 
<a name="new"></a>### 1. Creating a new tracking pixel

 To create a new tracking pixel, all you have to do is define the **name**, **category **and **conversion value**, and Suite will generate the code for you. <a name="view"></a>

### 2. Viewing your tracking pixels

 The tracking pixels you have already created are listed in the table with the following information:

- **Category** - these are used for Facebook's own Ads reporting screens. The options are: - **Checkouts**
- **Registration**
- **Leads**
- **Key Web Page Views**
- **Adds to Cart**
- **Other Web Conversions**
- **Status** - this shows whether or not the pixel has been added to a page and verified. The possible values are: - **Pending** - Facebook has not yet tried to validate this pixel
- **Unverified** - Facebook has tried to validate the pixel but was unsuccessful, most likely because the pixel has not yet been added to a web page, or was added with an error in the syntax
- **Active** - the pixel has been verified by Facebook
- **Conversion value** - this is the monetary value that you assign to each conversion (and will be n/a if the objective is not **Website conversions**). This can be entirely arbitrary and is only used to compare against the overall cost of the campaign, to see if the campaign represented a worthwhile return on investment.
