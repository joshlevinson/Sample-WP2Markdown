There are around 50 system fields per Suite account, with space for an additional 450 custom fields which can be created via the Suite user interface. These fields are used in forms and filters, for personalization as well as conditional text, and are used to store the data you import and export. There are eight different field types, each suited to storing different kinds of data. You should take care to select the most suitable field type, as this influences not only how the data is stored but also which filter conditions are available for segmentation. For example, numbers can be stored in both text fields and alphanumeric fields, but only the latter have the filter conditions ‘greater than‘ and ‘less than’.

<table border="0" cellpadding="1" class="wikitable" style="width: 100%; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;"><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left; border-color: #fff; background-color: #fff; color: #eb5a19;">**Please Note:**</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left; border-color: #fff; background-color: #fff; color: #555555;">The figure of 450 additional custom fields is an estimate, as the total number permitted will depend on the types of fields created. If you require more fields, an additional 500 can be added on request.</td></tr></tbody></table>### Creating fields

 Fields are created in the **Field Editor** (**Admin** menu). After you select the field type you can define names for it in all our supported languages. You can also define the default placement of the name in forms (left of the value field or above it), and define the options for single- and multiple-choice fields (including the order of available values) and a call to action. There is also the option to enhance the field functionality using JavaScript, for instance to limit the number of selections from a very large list. This should only be performed by a developer with JavaScript experience. For more information please contact Emarsys Support. ### Available field types
