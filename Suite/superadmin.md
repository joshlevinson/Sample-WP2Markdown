Welcome to the Suite Superadmin Guide
=====================================

 If you are reading this, you have most likely been selected to be the superadmin user for your Suite account. Below you can find all the information you need relating to this feature and your new role and responsibilities.

### What is a superadmin?

 Every suite account has one superadmin user. This user is responsible for:

- Inviting others to be Suite users
- Managing user accounts and permissions
- Deleting users

 The superadmin is selected when the account is created and is responsible for the overall user management for that account. This permission can only be transferred to another user by Emarsys Support.

### Why do we need a superadmin?

 The security of your data is of paramount importance to us, and we take all possible precautions to ensure that our application and infrastructure are safe (for an overview of these measures, please see: [Data Security in Emarsys Products](/Resources/data-security.md "Data Security in Emarsys Products")). Similarly, we want to give you as much control as possible over the access and permissions levels of your own users.

### Now that I am a superadmin, what do I do?

 You have two tasks to do when you are selected to be the superadmin for your account:

1. Validate and enable your own superadmin profile.
2. Invite and enable the rest of the users in your account.
 
**Note:** If you already have a Suite account, you will need to validate your existing users and enable/disable them, instead of inviting them. The steps required for this are the same. Please use this opportunity to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">delete any outdated user accounts</span> and make sure that the contact information for all users is accurate and up to date.

#### 1. Enabling your superadmin user

 The first point of contact for any new superadmin is an email that you will receive from Suite. You should follow the instructions in the email and click the link to set your password and validate your profile. You can then log in and begin to invite the rest of the users. When you activate your profile for the first time, you can select your user name and change your regional settings (language and timezone). To ensure the integrity of your account, your access role, email address and mobile phone number can only be changed by Emarsys Support. Once you have entered your settings, you can log directly from this screen into your Suite account.

#### 2. Defining the account security settings

 Your first action as superadmin should be to define the email domains to which your accounts users may belong. Suite will only send invitation emails to addresses in these domains. To enter the permitted domains, go to the **Admin** menu and select **Security Settings**. Enter the domain (e.g. *mycompany.com*) and click **Add**.

#### 3. Inviting other users

 To invite other people to be users in your account, proceed as follows:

1. In Suite, go to the **Admin** menu and click **Administrators**.
2. Click **Invite New Users**.
3. Enter the require information and click **Next**.
4. After confirming your request, click **Invite** to trigger the invitation email.

 After sending the email, the user will appear in the **Users** table and their **Verified** status will be **In progress**. Once they have entered their own details and logged in to the account, this will change to **Yes**. The user can now work with Suite according to their access level. Please note that the users you invite have 30 days to activate their profiles, after which their activation link becomes invalid and you must invite them again (see below).

#### 4. Managing users

 As superadmin, you can invite, disable, enable and delete users, as well as edit their profiles.

- **Inviting existing users** If a user has failed to activate their account in the first 30 days, or has not logged in for 90 days, they must be invited again. To do this, click the [![dot-dot-dot](/assets/images/dot-dot-dot.png)](/assets/images/dot-dot-dot.png) icon and select **Invite**. The entire process for step 2 above will be repeated.
- **Enabling and disabling users** If you want to block a user account temporarily, you can disable it by clicking the [![dot-dot-dot](/assets/images/dot-dot-dot.png)](/assets/images/dot-dot-dot.png) icon and selecting **Disable**. This user will no longer be able to log in and a message is displayed that their account has been disabled. To enable them again, simple repeat this process and select **Enable**.
- **Deleting users** User accounts can also be permanently deleted. Click [![dot-dot-dot](/assets/images/dot-dot-dot.png)](/assets/images/dot-dot-dot.png) and select **Delete**. You will be prompted to select an existing user who will inherit their assets.
- **Editing user profiles** Click [![edit-icon](/assets/images/edit-icon.png)](/assets/images/edit-icon.png) to open the profile page for the selected user. The only value here that you can change but the user themselves cannot is the **Access Role**.
