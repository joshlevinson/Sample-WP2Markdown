<a name="pause"></a>### 1. Pausing and resuming campaigns

 Once a campaign has been launched, you can pause it from the **Overview** table via the toggle switch on the left:

<div class="row">[![pause_resume_campaign](/assets/images/pause_resume_campaign.png)](/assets/images/pause_resume_campaign.png)</div><a name="view"></a>### 2. Viewing the results of a campaign

 Each campaign is displayed in the table with the following information:

- **Versions** – you can create multiple versions and Facebook will run its own A/B split testing for you
- **Status** – the available options are: - **In design** - these campaigns have not yet been launched
- **Pending** - these campaigns have been launched but Facebook has not yet started to display the ads
- **Active** - these campaigns have been launched and Facebook has started to display the ads
- **On hold** - these campaigns have been paused
- **Results** – this is the number of actions that resulted from your ad, as defined by the campaign objectives
- **Revenue** – this is the revenue collected by the tracking pixel that is associated with this campaign. This is not an exact figure, but rather the total orders multiplied by the average order value defined in your tracking pixel settings.
- **Reach** – this is the number of people who saw your ad<span style="color: #ff0000"> </span>
- **Impressions** – this is how many times your ad was displayed (including multiple times to the same person)
- **CPM** – this is the 'cost per mille' of your impressions, i.e. how much it cost your ads budget to display the ad 1,000 times
- **CTR** – this is the number of clicks divided by the number of impressions
- **CPC** – the 'cost per click' shows how much each click has cost you
- **Spent** – this is the total spent on the campaign so far

<a name="summary"></a>### 3. Viewing the detailed summary of a campaign

 To view a graphical summary of a campaign, click the [![edit-icon](/assets/images/results-icon.png)](/assets/images/results-icon.png) icon.

<div class="row">[![social-campaign-reporting](/assets/images/social-campaign-reporting.png)](/assets/images/social-campaign-reporting.png)</div> This shows the same results as the table but in graphical form. The main advantage of this page is that it lets you compare the results of different campaign versions, if you are using them. You can also hover your mouse over the results for a version (1) to see a more detailed breakdown of the analysis. You can also use the program reporting of the Automation Center to compare the results of Social Ads campaigns in the broader context of a multi-channel marketing program. <a name="editor"></a>  

### 4. Editing a campaign

 To edit a campaign, click the [![edit-icon](/assets/images/edit-icon.png)](/assets/images/edit-icon.png) icon to open the [campaign editor](/Suite/create-campaign.md "Creating Social Ads Campaigns"). <a name="copy"></a>

### 5. Copying and deleting a campaign

 To copy a campaign, click the [![copy-icon](/assets/images/copy-icon.png)](/assets/images/copy-icon.png) icon. This can be useful when you want to target a different audience with a similar campaign.

<table style="width: 100%"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left;width: 100px;border-color: #fff;background-color: #fff;color: #eb5a19">**Important Note:**</td> <td>You should not copy a campaign if you want to use it to target exactly the same audience; use the campaign versions instead. Otherwise there is a strong chance that you will have two of your own campaigns bidding against each other.</td></tr></tbody></table> To delete a campaign, click the **X **icon next to it. <a name="new"></a>

### 6. Creating a new campaign

 Click **Create Campaign** to open the [Campaign Settings](/Suite/edit-campaign.md "Editing Social Ads Campaigns") page.
