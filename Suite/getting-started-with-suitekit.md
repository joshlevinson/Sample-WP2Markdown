Prerequisites
-------------

 Before you start using Social Ads, you will need the following:

- A Facebook Ads account. You can read more about setting one up and defining your advertising budget in the [Facebook documentation](https://www.facebook.com/help/714656935225188/).
- A Facebook fan page. This is not absolutely necessary, but without one you cannot display ads in the News Feed.
- This feature will also have to be enabled for you by Emarsys Support.

Setup
-----

 Once this feature is enabled, your first step will be to [connect to your Facebook account](/Suite/configuration.md "Social Ads â€“ the Configuration page"). In Suite, open the **Campaigns** menu and select **Social Ads**. On the **Configuration** page you can open the Facebook login dialog and establish the connection between Suite and the Facebook Ads account you will be using. Once you are connected, you will need to define your monthly budget and select which Fan pages you want to use. Then you are ready to define your audiences and create the Social Ads campaigns to target them. Before you can create any custom audiences, you will also be asked to agree to the [Facebook Custom Audiences Terms & Conditions](https://www.facebook.com/ads/manage/customaudiences/tos.php).
