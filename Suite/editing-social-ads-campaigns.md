The Social Ads campaign editor is divided into three sections:

- [The Toolbar](#toolbar)
- [The Editor](#editor)
- [The Preview Pane](#preview)
 
<a name="toolbar"></a>###  1. The Toolbar

<div class="row">[![toolbar](/assets/images/toolbar.png)](/assets/images/toolbar.png)</div> On the toolbar you can:

- Return to the **Campaign Overview** page
- **Save** your changes
- Create new **Versions** for A/B testing. This testing is performed by Facebook, which will test all the versions you create and ensure that the best-performing one is shown most frequently. <table style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left; width: 80px; border-color: #fff; background-color: #fff; color: #eb5a19;">**Please Note:**</td> <td>If there is more than one version, the version name is displayed above the Editor.</td> </tr></tbody></table>
- Edit the **Campaign Settings**
- **Launch** the campaign.

 When you launch a campaign, Facebook will display a summary of the settings you have made:
