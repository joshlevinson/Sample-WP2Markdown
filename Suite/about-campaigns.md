### What is a campaign?

 When you create a Social Ads campaign in Suite, you are providing Facebook with: - The target audience
- The creatives for the ads themselves
- The campaign settings (duration, budget, ad placement, etc.)
 
 Once the campaign is activated, neither you nor Suite play any further part in the campaign execution. Facebook will target the selected audience with the adverts you have created, according to its own algorithms, until your monthly budget limit has been reached or the campaign reaches its end. Please note that Emarsys has no control over how and when Facebook displays your ads. All the settings and configuration you make provide Facebook Ads with the information it needs to make the optimal decisions on your behalf, but your ads are competing for space with other businesses and their success is therefore dependent to some degree on the budgets and settings of those other companies as well. You can use the **Campaign Overview** table to measure the success of past campaigns and then refine your audiences and creatives in order to optimize future campaigns. ### How does Facebook know what I want from my campaign?

 Facebook offers a number of settings for campaigns which will influence the way that it bids for your Ads. Social Ads supports only the most relevant ones, in particular: - **Campaign objectives** - Social Ads supports two campaign objectives: - **Clicks to website** - this tells Facebook that I am interested in driving traffic to my website. This is a very general and flexible objective to use
- **Website conversions** - this requires that you have a valid (i.e. verified by Facebook) tracking pixel linked to this campaign, which you have placed on your conversion web page. This page could be the Check-out page, a 'Thank You' page...wherever you want to measure the conversion that you have defined as the **Category** for the pixel.
- **Bidding Strategy** - Social Ads offers two bidding strategies: - **Optimize for actions** - this refers to the action defined as the **Campaign objective**. Facebook will bid in order to maximize the chance of a click or a conversion
- **Optimize for impressions** - Facebook will bid in order to ensure that the maximum number of users see this ad

##### Emarsys recommends...

 Facebook uses highly advanced algorithms to help its customers find the right recipients for their Ads, because in many cases the customer does not know exactly who they are looking for. In Suite, by contrast, you are already creating highly specific audiences, so we are not so reliant on this technology. Therefore we find that in most cases, an objective of **Clicks to website** combined with a bidding strategy of** Optimize for impressions** will deliver the best results because the same budget will reach more users. <table style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left; width: 80px; border-color: #fff; background-color: #fff; color: #eb5a19;">**Please Note:**</td> <td>When using a **lookalike audience**, it might make more sense to optimize for **Website conversions** and bid for **actions**, because you are entirely reliant on Facebook finding the users for you, and with these settings you will get fewer, but more valuable, successful bids.</td></tr></tbody></table>
