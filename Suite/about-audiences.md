### What is an audience?

 Custom audiences are lists of Facebook users which correspond to the contact lists and segments that you create in Suite. Facebook creates these audiences for you by checking for user profiles associated with email addresses you provide.

A Facebook audience must have a minimum of 20 contacts for Facebook to use it for ad targeting. Read more about audiences in the [Facebook documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs).

### What kind of audiences does Social Ads support?

 Social Ads supports three kinds of audiences:

##### Blank audiences

These start empty and can only be filled by contacts who arrive at a certain point in an Automation Center program. Each contact is sent to Facebook in real time (when they reach the right node) and, if they match a user profile, are added to the audience.

Once the audience reaches the minimum number of 20 users, Facebook will begin to use it for display advertising. Contacts can also be removed from these audiences, by arriving at the corresponding node.

**Summary:** Blank audiences are the most flexible option because you can control exactly who enters and leaves the audience, and when.

##### Custom audiences based on existing Suite segments

These are based directly on a segment you create. Facebook will fill the audience with every user who matches one of the email addresses in your segment.

These audiences can be created once and left unchanged, or can be kept dynamically up-to-date every 15 minutes.

**Summary:** Custom audiences are a great way to make sure that you are reaching the right people with the right message, just like with email.

#####  Lookalike audiences

These are new custom audiences that Facebook creates by itself, based on a custom audience that you provide (which is in turn based on a segment, e.g. Platinum Buyers). Facebook uses its own algorithms to find users who match the contacts in your audience, providing you with a great channel for acquiring new customers who share interests and/or friends with your existing customer base.

You can also base a Lookalike audience on the fans of one of your Facebook fan pages. Simply select the page as the source for the audience and Facebook will look for users who share the same interests and characteristics as that page's fans.

**Summary:** Lookalike audiences are a great way to harness the technology and reach of Facebook to find new, high-value customers.
