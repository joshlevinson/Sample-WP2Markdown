Once you have finished and tested your email you can proceed to the scheduling stage. Here you define when the email will be launched, how many recipients to send it to (full or part launch), as well as selecting the versions to send if you are using the A/B Testing feature. There are two scheduling modes in Suite: Simple and Advanced.

### Simple Scheduling

 If you are launching an ad hoc email, which is not based on an event or part of an Automation Center program, and are not using any advanced features such as A/B Testing, Suite will automatically select the Simple Scheduling mode. This shows you the total number of contacts in the contact list or segment, as well as how many of them have no opt-in. <table cellpadding="1" class="wikitable" style="width: 100%; border: 0px;"><tbody><tr><td scope="col" style="text-align: left; border: 0px solid #999; vertical-align: top;" width="60px">![Icon BeCareful.png](/assets/images/2014/04/Icon_BeCareful.png)</td> <td scope="col" style="border: 0px solid #999; vertical-align: top; color: #555555;">If you are sending to a segment, the figure here will only be accurate according to the last time the filter was run to create the segment. The filter will be run again immediately prior to launch and so the final launch list may not have the same total.If you have not yet run the filter, or changed some of the conditions since you last applied it, there will be no figures available. In this case an **Update** link will be available for you to refresh the segment.</td> </tr></tbody></table> Simple Scheduling lets you launch an email campaign (or schedule one for launch) very quickly, because you do not need to generate the launch list first or check the personalization. If you do want to generate the launch list (and get a more representative total for your recipients), or see what percentage of recipients will see your personalizations, you can switch to Advanced Scheduling. <table cellpadding="1" class="wikitable" style="width: 100%; border: 0px solid #999;"><tbody><tr><td scope="col" style="text-align: left; border: 0px solid #999; vertical-align: top;" width="60px">![Icon AdditionalInfo.png](/assets/images/2014/04/Icon_AdditionalInfo.png)</td> <td scope="col" style="border: 0px solid #999; vertical-align: top; color: #555555;">Although you cannot check the personalization in Simple Scheduling mode, you can still define alternative text for the personalization variables in the Content Creation page.</td></tr></tbody></table>### Advanced Scheduling

 If your email has A/B versions or you are using personalization variables in the From (name) field (or if you are using certain other on-demand features), Suite will automatically select Advanced Scheduling for your campaign. In this mode you can see not only the recipients in your contact list or segment, and which of these have no opt-in, but also which are considered invalid, i.e. have previously been bounced. You can also generate the launch list again, which will refresh the recipient source. If your launch list is very large, this may take several minutes. #### Launch type

 Select **Final mailing** to send the email to all recipients, or select **Send test email** to use the A/B Testing feature. #### Select version to send

 If you are using the A/B Testing feature, here you define the percentage of the launch list for each version. The test versions you must select manually: the final version will be selected automatically based on the response criteria you choose. #### Set schedule

 Here you select when the email campaign will be launched. If you schedule the campaign in the future, you can also define a specific time zone (e.g. the time zone of the target country). In this case, the launch takes place at the specified local time of that time zone, and this launch time is displayed with that time zone’s GMT offset. When scheduling a launch in the future, you can instruct the system to update the launch list (i.e. recipient source) before launching using the **Generate new launch list before launching email campaign** checkbox. This option is activated by default. #### Send email

 When you have completed your preparations and are ready to launch the email, you need to check the personalization variables. The **Check Personalization** pop-up shows you how many recipients (as a %) have a value for each variable, and allows to you define alternative text for those without, as well as omit recipients without a value for this field from the email completely. Click the **Start Launch** button to finish, and your campaign is now done.
