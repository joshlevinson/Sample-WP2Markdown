The first task to perform when starting with Emarsys Predict is to integrate Web Extend into your website. This takes a few hours to complete, after which the scripts begin to collect visitor data. [**Click here to get started with Web Extend.**](/Getting%20Started/implementation.md "The Web Extend Scripts") Once Web Extend has been implemented, you have a couple of weeks while the scripts collect data and you can use this time to think about designing your Predict widgets and where to place them in your emails and on your website. See the [**Use Cases and Examples**](/Predict/use-cases.md "Best Practices and Examples") for more information and helpful tips. You can also direct your technical support to the following pages which contain helpful information when integrating the recommendations into your web shop and email campaigns:
