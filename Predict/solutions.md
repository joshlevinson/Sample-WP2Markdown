Emarsys Predict offers four solutions:

- [Email Recommender](#email)
- [Cart Recovery](#cart)
- [Mobile recommendations](#mobile)<a name="web"></a>

### Web Recommender

 Web recommendations are provided by six widgets, each of which uses a model specifically designed for different kinds of web pages. These widgets will enhance each step of the buying process in your web shop to increase website engagement, time on site, conversions and help increase basket value as well as increase customer loyalty.

- **Topical** - for a fully personalized home page experience. It displays a personally relevant list of topics organized into multiple boxes (see below).
- **Personal** - for personalized recommendations on the home page and search pages.
- **Category** - for personalized recommendations within a given category, on the home page and search pages.
- **Related** - for related/similar product recommendations on product pages.
- **Cart** - for complementary product recommendations on the cart page.
- **Also_Bought** - for complementary product recommendations on product pages.

 For examples on how to use these widgets, please see the [Web Recommender Use Cases and Examples](/GettingStarted_Predict/webrec.md).

##### **Predictive Home Page **

 This is a special solution which uses the **Topical** widget, and lets you create a homepage that is unique for every user. You can give each and every customer a more personal, more engaging experience from the moment they arrive at your site. They will see recommendations personalized across categories and products, all delivered in the optimal order. Even first-time visitors will get an optimized version of the homepage, as the products displayed will change in real time depending on the current browse and purchase behavior of your other customers. In other words, it means that you always promote the offers that have the highest chance of conversion, automatically. With this solution you can:

- Dynamically tailor your homepage with relevant offers and recommendations.
- Personalize across both categories and products.
- Extend optimization to first-time, unknown visitors.
- Integrate easily with any homepage design.
- Create more sales opportunities with every customer visit.<a name="email"></a>

### Email Recommender

 Email recommendations are provided by four widgets, each of which uses your customers' browse and purchase activity to offer different content depending on the purpose of your email campaign:

- **Personal** – delivers personalized product recommendations to recipients based on their recent browse activity and purchase history.
- **Abandoned** – delivers the last products abandoned in cart by the recipient, and other product recommendations related to these.
- **Post_purchase** – delivers complementary product recommendations based on the last purchased items.
- **Category** – delivers personalized product recommendations from specific categories.

 Any kind of email campaign will benefit from intelligent product recommendations, including:

- Welcome emails
- Ad hoc newsletters
- Re-engagement campaigns
- Birthday congratulations
- Transactional messages

### Cart Recovery

 Cart Recovery is an email recommendation solution that uses our advanced Predict engine to make compelling, relevant, unique offers – right when they’ll have the greatest effect. By using our Unified Profile identification, we can identify and capture more abandoned carts, faster. Send your customers an email within an hour of abandoning a cart. The email will contain dynamic content, with recommendations and offers tailored directly to them. When used in combination with the Automation Center, you can also trigger a fall-back programme that deploys further emails and Facebook advertising. The result? Lower cart abandonment, higher sales and happier customers. With this solution you can:

- Trigger activity from a single ‘add to cart’ action.
- Identify more abandoned carts, more accurately and in less time.
- Bring everything together with an in-depth Unified Profile.
- Trigger follow-ups within an hour of cart abandonment.
- Add dynamic content, incentives and recommendations to every communication.<a name="mobile"></a>

 And of course the power of Predict recommendations can also be unleashed on your mobile storefront and dedicated app.
