#### What is Emarsys Predict?

 Predict is a recommendation engine which analyzes the behavior data collected from your web shop by Web Extend and uses this to deliver personalized recommendations to all your customer across email, mobile and web. A self-learning marketing solution, Predict intelligently creates real-time, personalized content based on the online behavior of your entire customer base. Anonymous behavior contributes to general affinity models covering your entire product catalog, while behavior from known customers (who have logged in or accessed the shop via a tracked link in an Emarsys campaign) is built into a unique, personal profile for that customer. Predict is made up of three separate solutions, which are explained in more detail on the next page: - Web Recommender
- Email Recommender
- Cart Recovery<a name="why"></a>

We measure this attribution as follows: - **Web recommendations** When a customer clicks a recommendation in the website and purchases that product in the same session, we attribute this revenue to Predict.
