One of the most important steps when implementing Predict is to ensure that your product catalog is complete and always up to date. After the initial upload, a daily schedule will be set up with Emarsys Support. In this way we make sure that your Predict recommendations always accurately reflect the status of your inventory. On the **Product Catalogs** page you can enter the location of your product catalog and upload it for the first time. The **Validate catalog** button will check this file for consistency and highlight any errors. Below this is a table listing all catalog uploads and their status.
