The ***Related*** widget offersÂ similar items to those currently being viewed. It does this by looking at the browse behavior for the whole web shop and identifying product-to-product relationships. For example, if a visitor expresses an interest in cameras, the widget might display similar cameras as well as the current best-selling camera accessories. The ideal location for this widget is right next to the product being viewed, within the product page. It should be placed either below or to the side of the product being viewed, so that the widget is visible without the need for scrolling.
