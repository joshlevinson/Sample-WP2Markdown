The Technology Behind Emarsys Predict
=====================================

 Emarsys Predict is a recommendation engine that helps you improve your marketing ROI by presenting the right content to the right people, at the right time and in the right place. It is flexible, measurable and reliable, and sits on top of an exceptionally lightweight client-side integration. This diagram gives an easy overview of what Predict does and how this benefits your business model:

Here are just a few of the reasons why Predict really is one step ahead of the rest.

#### Behind the Scenes

 Our state-of-the-art machine learning software processes diverse behavioral data including page views, checkouts, add-to-cart events and search queries. Millions of customer interactions with thousands of products can be processed in real time, giving up-to-the-minute, individual recommendations with every page refresh. Our ongoing research provides a constant feed of new science that’s tested and built right into the core product, giving you a living, evolving and continually improving platform.

#### Understanding the Buying Process

 Each Predict recommendation model is designed specifically for its respective stage of the buying process (research & discovery, cart, purchase, post-purchase) and is tailored to take into account behavior differences according to the channel in which it is being served (e.g. email or web).

#### Data Cleansing

 Predict has a built-in mechanism that filters out traffic noise and irregular online behavior from the learning algorithms, making sure we capture genuine crowd behavior. In other words, non-human visitors (internet robots) and institutional buyers don’t affect us.

#### Feature Attractor Model

 We have an advanced algorithm for dealing with long-tail items with little or no behavioral traffic. Thanks to this model, clients with large or frequently changing catalogues don’t have to suffer from the “cold-start” problem, and new visitors can get meaningful recommendations right from day one.

#### Unified Profile

 Predict uses cookies to identify anonymous website visitors in order to personalize their experience across desktop, mobile and tablet devices. Through the unique identifier, Emarsys technology is able to recognize users across various channels (website, email and mobile) and combine their browsing behavior into one Unified Profile. By merging cross-channel behavior into a single record we are able to ensure the most personalized experience for each individual user. In addition, thanks to the tight integration between our recommendation engine and the Suite email infrastructure, anonymous profiles are easily matched with identified contacts, which ensures maximum touch-point coverage. The result is that you can personalize significantly more email to more contacts than you could hope to achieve by integrating 3rd-party recommendation engines with an ESP.

#### Technical Pre-requisites

 The only pre-requisites are an Emarsys account and a web shop whose [design is suitable](/Gettingstarted/about.md) for this kind of data capture and one-to-one targeting.

#### Integration

 Predict setup requires only the integration of the Web Extend Scripts, which can be done by your web master in a matter of hours by following our [comprehensive documentation](http://emarsys.dev/old/getstarted/first-steps/web-extend/). Following that it is simply a case of placing your recommendations where they will have the best effect.

#### Health check tools

 A suite of [health check tools](/Predict/user-guide.md) have been provided in Emarsys which provide a continuous overview of the status of the integration.
