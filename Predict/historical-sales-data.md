### Importing Historical Sales Data

 Although collecting traffic and sales data is continuous, our Dashboard offers the option to upload Historical Sales Data to jumpstart our behavioral models. If enough data about past purchases can be included in the analysis, we may be able to start serving high quality recommendations right from the start. The more data you can upload, the faster you can get high quality recommender performance. This step is performed in the **Predict** menu in Emarsys and needs to be done only once. **Please note:** Historical sales data should be uploaded in the structure shown below, and as in the case of the catalogue, the file should be a UTF-8 Unicode encoded CSV file.

<table border="0" cellpadding="1" class="wikitable" style="width: 100%; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;"><thead><tr><th>order</th> <th>item</th> <th>customer</th> <th>date</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>876</td> <td>123456</td> <td>875453</td> <td>2010-03-21T13:21:45Z</td> </tr><tr><td>876</td> <td>43231</td> <td>875453</td> <td>2010-03-21T13:21:45Z</td></tr></tbody></table>### Validating and Uploading New Data

 Once you have uploaded your data file, you can validate it in Emarsys to check for errors. You can also upload new data at any time. [![historical-sales-data](/assets/images/2015/07/historical-sales-data.png)](/assets/images/2015/07/historical-sales-data.png)
