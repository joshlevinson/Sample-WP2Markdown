Before you start to design and implement your recommendation widgets, we recommend that you read these pages to get a better understanding of what Predict can do for you and your business. Here we describe what we regard as theÂ **absolute minimum** best practices that you should follow to take proper advantage of the **automated revenue generation** Predict canÂ provide. ComparingÂ your customers' own browsing and purchase data with your product catalog, the Predict widgets can place the right content for each individual visitor on all of your web pages, as well as provide up-to-date recommendations for your email campaigns.

#### Predict Widgets Used in these Examples

 In your web shop:

<table class="wikitable"><thead><tr><th>Widget</th> <th>Description</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>**Personal**</td> <td>Personalized recommendations which match a visitor's known characteristics and interests.</td> </tr><tr><td>**Related**</td> <td>Similar items to those currently being viewed.</td> </tr><tr><td>**Cart**</td> <td>Complementary or related items to those left in a shopping cart.</td> </tr><tr><td>**Also Bought**</td> <td>Items that have often been bought alongside those currently being viewed.</td></tr></tbody></table> In your email campaigns:

<table class="wikitable"><thead><tr><th>Widget</th> <th>Description</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>**Mail Personal**</td> <td>Delivers personalized product recommendations to email recipients based on recent browse and purchase history.</td> </tr><tr><td>**Cart Abandoned**</td> <td>Delivers the last itemsÂ left inÂ aÂ cart by the email recipient, as well as product recommendations related to these.</td> </tr><tr><td>**Post Purchase**</td> <td>Cross- & up-sell recommendations based on the items purchased.</td></tr></tbody></table> Our experience has shown us that where and how you place your widgets can have a major impact on their efficacy, so we want to you get it right first time. The use cases are based around a typicalÂ buying process where the visitor browses items, decides whether to add them to the shopping cart, and ends the session either by purchasing them or abandoning them in the cart.
