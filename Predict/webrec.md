The Web Recommender widgets can be placed in any page on your website. They can display a variety of cross- and up-sell recommendations in different locations, in order to make the most of the customer's visit to your site. The Web Recommender uses the following widgets:

##### Personal

 Personalized recommendations which match a visitor's known characteristics and interests, based on their own browse history and the wisdom of the crowd. It helps them to find products they are interested in before they even know they want them.** ** This widget is aimed at web stickiness and not conversion. It reduces browse abandonment by making it faster and easier to find the right product.

- Ideal for a client with a very large product catalog.
- Located on the home page.
- Based on the customer, not the products.
- First-time visitors will have the current Top Sellers as default.

##### Related

 Alternative product offerings to the item being viewed. Based on the customer's browse history and the wisdom of the crowd, this is designed to boost conversion.

- Located on product pages.
- Can display both alternative brands or complementary items.
- Ideal for cross- and up-selling.

##### Also_Bought

 The classic 'people who bought ***x***, also bought ***y***' widget. This is a more targeted version of the **Related** widget, and can be used well in combination with it.

- Located on product and cart pages.
- Provides advice and insights, like an experienced shop assistant.
- Improves the experience, enhances loyalty.

#####  Cart

 Similar to **Also_Bought**, this widget takes the recommendations one level deeper by analyzing the *entire content of the cart* before offering complementary items.

- Located on the cart page.
- Can remind customers of items they have forgotten (e.g. a spare power cord for cars, an extra SD card, etc.).
- Increases cart value and reduces abandonment.

##### Category

 Similar to **Personal**, this widget offers products within the specific category of the product they are viewing.

- For companies with a large and varied product catalog, direct the customer to the most relevant or profitable products within each category.
- Enhance the experience with more targeted recommendations.
- Useful for inventory management.

- Additionally on **Product pages**, use the [*Also-Bought* widget](/Getting%20Started/web-also.md "Example 3: Using the Also-Bought Widget") to give real examples of what other customers also bought.
- On the **Checkout page**, use the [*Cart* widget](/Getting%20Started/web-cart.md "Example 4: Using the Cart Widget") on the checkout page to maximize the value of the order as it is being carried out, and reduce cart abandonment.
