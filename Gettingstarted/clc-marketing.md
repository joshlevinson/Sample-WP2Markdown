Effective customer engagement means sending the right message, to the right contacts, at the right time. For this to work you need to track your customers over every stage of the lifecycle, and target them appropriately. With the Suite Automation Center, you can trigger any number of automated emails based either on customer actions or on recurring segments (both regular Suite segments and Smart Insight segments).

#### Examples

- Welcome and double opt-in emails for new registrations
- Abandoned shopping cart campaigns
- Post-purchase follow-up
- Loyalty schemes
- Winback campaigns
 
 Suite provides a number blueprints for digital marketing programs which will give you an idea of the flexibility and scope of the Automation Center. Please log in to your Suite account and familiarise yourself with what the Automation Center can do.Â Emarsys Support will be happy to advise you on making the most of this feature to enhance your customer engagement strategy.
