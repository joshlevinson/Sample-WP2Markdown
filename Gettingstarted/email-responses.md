#### Suite Email Analysis

 Suite provides a comprehensive set of tools for displaying the responses of your email campaigns. These include:

- A full breakdown of the launch statistics, including planned number of recipients, those excluded by blacklists, poor email syntax, frequency cap, etc.
- Deliverability statistics, showing delivered emails and soft, hard and block bounces
- Email repsonses, including clicks, opens and share on social media

 Additionally, you can identify trends in response activity over time, break the responses down by time of day and days of the week, and seek how many contacts are opening on mobile devices.

#### Exporting responses

 The total figues for each email can be exported, as well as a complete breakdown of activity by contact, either over time or per email category.

#### Ecommerce tracking

 Suite provides a simple ecommerce tracking module that can be installed in your web shop using Javascript or an image pixel. For more information on how to implement this, please see: [The Suite Ecommerce Tracking feature](/Suite/ecommerce-tracking-analysis.md "Ecommerce Tracking Analysis").
