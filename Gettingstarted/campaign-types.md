Email campaigns can be generally categorised into two types:

#### Batch campaigns

 A batch campaign sends the same message needs to many recipients at the same time. Within this message, content can be targeted at different segments within the launch list.

#### Transactional emails

 Transactional messages, or real-time messages, go out to a single recipient and are triggered by a specific event. Some events can be selected in the Suite interface. These events can include:

- Registration through Suite forms
- Submitting other forms such as Contact Us or Change Profile
- Specific dates (e.g. birthdays)

 You can also trigger events via the Suite API or external integrations. For more information on the different types of transactional emails available, please see: **[Sending Transactional Emails in Suite](/Suite/txm.md "Transactional Emails in Suite").**
