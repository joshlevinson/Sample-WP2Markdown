Now that you have looked at out how you will transfer contact data in and out of Suite, we'd like to turn your attention to the emails you will be sending.

- [What kind of campaigns will you send?](/Gettingstarted/campaign-types.md "Email Campaign Types")

 Suite can send everything from large, batch campaigns to target customer lifecycle messages and individual transactional emails. We also offer a host of email features, some of which are out-of-the-box and some require implementation on our part or on yours. The type of campaigns you send will determine how you proceed with the next steps.

- [Who is your target audience?](/Gettingstarted/create-lists.md "Creating Launch Lists")

- [When will you send it?](/Gettingstarted/launching-emails.md "Launching Emails")
