The Suite Email Campaign Manager has a simple interface for launching emails manually or scheduling them to launch in the future. You can set them up to launch after a specific event, and create recurring emails where the content is automatically via RSS.

#### Customer lifecycle emails

 In the Suite Automation Center, you can create multi-step customer lifecycle campaigns where emails are launched according to the behavior or properties of the contacts as they progress along their customer journey.

#### External integrations

 And of course you can use the [Suite API](/Gettingstarted/suite-api.md "Getting Started with the Suite API") to launch emails from an external application.
