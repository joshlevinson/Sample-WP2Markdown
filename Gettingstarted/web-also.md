The ***Also Bought*** widget offers recommendations based on items that have frequently been bought withÂ the item currently being viewed. This is particularly useful for web shops that sell items such as cameras which come with a lot of accessories.

For example, on the detailed description page of a product. It can also be used well in conjunction with the ***Related** *widget.
