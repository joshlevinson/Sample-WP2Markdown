Product Development at Emarsys
==============================

 At Emarsys, our development planning is based around two distinct goals:

- Introducing innovative new products which anticipate the future requirements of the market
- Making our present platform even better, based on direct feedback from our customers

 For a sneak preview of what is coming in the next official version release, please visit our [**Support portal**](https://help.emarsys.com/). This will list the planned features, the timeline of the release and any functionality that may already be available as part of a pilot phase. The planned features on our roadmap is grouped into the following categories:

- **The core application **The Emarsys eMarketing Suite core application allows you to manage your assets, create and automate campaigns and analyze the results of your communications.
- **The channels** Successful communication has to be based on an omnichannel marketing strategy, making sure to reach out to your customers in multiple ways to maximize your results. We are committed to help marketers make this happen in an intelligent, intuitive and flexible way. - **Mobile** Mobile is no longer just another channel, itâ&#128;&#153;s an integral aspect of customer behavior. Unlike the era of desktops, the prevalence of handheld devices makes content delivery far more immediate than it ever was before. For Emarsys, mobile means a bi-directional value stream. First, delivering a message via mobile-friendly email, SMS and push notifications. Secondly, capturing data from the mobile device. This means collecting details on preferred devices, preferred locations, app behavior, etc., and can lead to the triggering of events with geo-targeting or in-store beacons, and many more exciting opportunities. This bi-directional value stream will ensure that our customers are at the forefront in meeting the consumers' standards for what they can expect from the brands they choose to engage with.
- **The engines** The Emarsys platform is built on highly sophisticated technology that takes care of everything from content personalization, recommendations, segmentation and scoring and of course delivery of the message itself. We are constantly improving and upgrading our infrastructure to ensure that our customers continue to enjoy the most stable, responsive and secure application possible.
- **Emarsys Connect **Connect is our integration layer and operates throughout the entire platform. It helps us to extend the functionality we offer by enabling partners and customers to develop custom elements within the application, or use plug-in integrations. The main integration points are: - The Suite API for communication and developing functionality between Suite and 3<sup>rd</sup> party platforms
- Automation Center nodes that trigger when to send data to the 3<sup>rd</sup> party platforms
- The Javascript API that allows external developers to extend screens in suite
- Secure authentication protocols to allow partners to display their own screens inside Suite in a single sign on manner.

### Continuous delivery

 Our eMarketing Suite development team works in small teams using Agile methodologies. This means we donâ&#128;&#153;t get bogged down in big development cycles of several months - we can bring individual updates and improvements online continuously, testing them with selected customers before making them generally available. Every three months or so we consolidate these improvements into a new Suite version. Regardless of the size of the project, each development team works in the following phases:

1. **Strategy** - Listening to the marketsâ&#128;&#153; and our clientsâ&#128;&#153; needs and work on ideas for new and innovative features.
2. **Research** - Speak to clients personally and analyze their feedback, discuss planned features internally with different stakeholders.
3. **Specification** - Mockup and specify new features in detail.
4. **Development** - Actual development work on the selected features, getting feedback from pilot projects.
5. **Rollout** - Communicate new functionalities to existing clients, update documentation and roll out features to all customer accounts.

 To stay agile during this process we test and adjust continuously, and are also able to handle important new feature requests. For added flexibility, we also always work on two release cycles simultaneously, which means while actually developing for one release we are already planning, researching and setting specifications for the next.
