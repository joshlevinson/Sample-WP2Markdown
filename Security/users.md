eMarketing Suite users fall into two broad categories:

- **Administrators**

 These are the only people authorized to create and edit other system users. In addition to this, administrators may have full access to all of the eMarketing Suite features, or a restricted set of permissions as defined by you.

- **Operators**

 These cannot create system users, but can work with as many other features as their access package dictates. Within these two categories, you can define the activities of each user however you like. For example, you may want some users to be allowed to create and edit email campaigns, but not launch them; or others may need to import contacts and perform duplication handling, but do not need access to the Suite CMS. Speak to Emarsys Support for a list of the available access packages.

 All the controls for creating, editing and deleting users can be found in the **Admin** menu, **Administrators**. When creating a new user, or editing an existing one, you will have to define the following properties:

- **User name** - must be unique to this account
- **Email address** - this address is used for manual exports as well as for product and feature notifications
- **Password** - to create a password for new users, click **Change Password**, enter and confirm the password and define its period of validity, then click **Save**. You must observe our password security requirements!
- **Access level** - select from a list of available levels
- **Interface Language** - this specifies the interface (GUI) language for the user, and can be changed at any time
- **Default language for forms** - here you assign the default language for all the forms and fields created by this user. Please note that for emails, the language will still have to be selected each time an email is created.
- **Time Zone** - here you select the time zone in which all times will be displayed in the GUI for this user (unless explicitly shown otherwise, e.g. with a specific GMT offset). This setting overwrites the account default time zone.
- **Mobile Phone** - this field is read-only and shows the mobile phone number which is used for sms authentication, if this feature is enabled.

 All other user information is optional.

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Deleting_users">Deleting users<a name="bs-ue-jumpmark-71e3d4b39879f76af35a90cf656760ef"></a></span>

 Only an administrator can delete other users. Before you do this, you must select another existing user to take over the rights and activities of the deleted user. All forms, fields and emails created by the deleted user will be inherited by the person you choose.

###  The Superadmin feature

 We currently have a pilot project to test a new user management system for Suite. [Click here for details](/SuiteAdmin/superadmin.md "The Superadmin Feature").
