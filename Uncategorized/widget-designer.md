If you are using an Emarsys template for your emails, you can [easily include recommendations](/Predict/email-recomendations-video.md) in your emails directly from the Emarsys CMS. If you are using your own HTML code, use the Widget Builder to create great-looking recommendation widgets to include in your email.

1. On the **Recommendations** tab, select the number of items to show and the recommendation logic:
