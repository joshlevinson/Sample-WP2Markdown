### Introduction

 Emarsys eMarketing Suite supports a direct integration with Salesforce, allowing you to synchronize data between the two applications. This integration is installed as an App in Salesforce and requires no configuration in Suite itself. This integration is ideal for businesses that use Salesforce as their main CRM, but also want to take full advantage of the sophisticated automation and multi-channel campaign functionality offered by Suite. New leads and contacts are collected in Salesforce and automatically synchronized with Suite, where they can immediately appear in the appropriate customer lifecycle segments and participate in the relevant Automation Center programs. Conversely, all response data is returned on a daily basis to Salesforce. The main features of the integration can be summarized as follows:

- Export of new Salesforce contacts/leads to Suite
- Automatic updates of existing contacts/leads in Suite
- Mapping fields for exports and automatic updates
- Export of email responses from Suite to Salesforce
- Export of unsubscribers from Suite to Salesforce
- Salesforce campaign automation

### Requirements

 In order to be able to use this integration, you will require Emarsys eMarketing Suite API credentials. If you are not already a Suite API use, please contact Emarsys Support. Additionally, you need one of the following Salesforce products:

- Salesforce Enterprise Edition
- Salesforce Unlimited Edition
- Salesforce Developer Edition (for testing purposes only)
- Salesforce Professional Edition (will be supported in a future product version)
