Web Extend is a pre-requisite for Predict and Smart Insight, but it can also be used on its own to enhance your customer lifecycle marketing, thanks to the fields it updates in your Emarsys database. Below are some example of simple campaigns you can automate using these fields.

#### Lead conversion / browse abandonment

 Use the **predict last session date** and **predict last purchase date** fields to identify leads who have visited your site but not yet bought anything. Combine them with **predict last session time spent** and **predict last session categories** to gauge their level of engagement and the products they are interested in, and target them with incentives accordingly. #### Inventory management / product promotions

 Use the** predict last session categories**, **predict last abandoned categories** and **predict last purchase categories** fields to segment contacts you know to be interested in these products and target them with stock-clearance and back-in-stock campaigns, as well as cross- and up-sell campaigns. #### Abandoned cart

 Use the **predict last abandoned date** and **predict last abandoned categories** fields to trigger timely reminders to customers of what they left behind. Combine it with **predict last abandoned total price** to offer different incentives based on total cart value. I this way you can recover up to 20% of your abandoned purchases! How many of your shopping carts are abandoned? #### Winback / reactivation

 The fields **predict last session date** and **predict last purchase date** give you a good indication of when customers are beginning to defect. Combine them with **predict last purchase categories** to offer targeted incentives. ### Additional use cases

#### Better personalization

 You can also use these fields to personalize sections of ad hoc email campaigns with dynamic content that will increase click-through-rates and conversions. For example: - Use the **predict last session/abandoned/purchase categories** fields to select the right content based on their last preference.
- Use the **predict last abandoned session/cart/purchase** fields to segment your audience according to their level of engagement and treat them accordingly.

#### Export data for use in other activities

 Targeted lists can be generated based on the data collected through Web Extend and subsequently exported for use in other marketing activities. For example: - A high value for **predict last session time spent** with no corresponding** predict last purchase date** may indicate problems with your shopping experience.
- A high** predict last purchase total price** may merit one-to-one interaction from your Customer Services, such as invitation to a loyalty scheme.
- You can also match purchase activity with email responses and consider targeting individuals through other channels for better conversion.
