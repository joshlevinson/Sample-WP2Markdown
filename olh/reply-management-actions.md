**Admin menu -> Reply Management -> Actions On the **Actions** tab, you create reply mailboxes and decide how reply mails are to be handled.

#### Create reply mailbox

1. Click **Create New** to open the corresponding dialog box.
2. Replace the **undefined** string with a string of your choice. This constitutes the address component prefixing the @ sign; for the domain name suffixing the @ sign you can use either** eemms.net** (the Emarsys eMarketing Suite email domain) or an [existing customized domain/subdomain](/olh/reply-domains.md "Admin – Domain Setup for Reply Management").

**Attention**: The domain/subdomain you specify is reserved for Emarsys eMarketing Suite emails. You cannot use email domains for which you have already set up inboxes with other mail servers.

1. Click **Create Address** to add the address to the list.
2. To remove an address, tick the corresponding check box and click **Delete Address**.

#### Define how to handle reply mails

1. Select a **Reply mailbox**.
2. Click **Edit**.
3. For each category you can select one of the following actions:

- **Forward** – reply emails with this category assigned are forwarded to one or several email addresses, which you can enter in the Forward to column. Multiple email addresses must be separated by ‘;’.
- **Forward with action buttons** - reply emails with this category assigned are forwarded to one or several email addresses, which you can enter on the right; action buttons are included.
- **Ignore** – reply emails with this category assigned can be ignored; e.g. Out-of-Office emails.


 If you want the system to automatically delete the reply mails after the defined action has been performed, activate the **Delete** option. Click **Save** to save your settings.
