**Analysis menu ->** Emails** ->** Open Rate Over Time** This section breaks down the **Open Rate** both by days and hours, and you can define the range by using the **Date Range** field, or using the **Custom Date Range** on the right. As with the [Click rate](/olh/analysis-click-rate-over-time.md "Analysis Ã¢&#128;&#147; Click Rate Over Time") you can click the date to get an hourly breakdown of when the emails were opened during the day. This gives you an indication of:

- How quickly are emails opened
- When the activity is highest
