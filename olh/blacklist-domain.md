**Admin menu -> Internal Blacklist -> Domain** The table displays all blacklisted domain entries, the name of the administrator who added them and the date they were added. Clicking any column header sorts the entries in ascending or descending order, based on the column you chose (e.g. domain, administrator, date added). - To add a domain to your Internal Blacklist, enter it in the field at the top left and click **Add Domain**.
- If you have a list with many domains to add to the Internal Blacklist, you can **upload** it. Lists can be either TXT or CSV format and make sure the domain names are in the first column. **Important**: If domain names are not in the first column, then the import will not add any of them to the blacklist.
- If you want to remove a single entry, check the box next to it and then click **Delete**. To remove all entries on the page click **Select all** and then **Delete**. To remove all domains in your blacklist, click **Empty Blacklist**.
- Click **Search** to look for an individual domain (you do not need to enter the full name).
