**Forms menu ->** Settings** On the **General settings** page you customize forms with regard to their text layout and the images they use, and you define the opt-in invitation/opt-out request in more detail. On the **General Format** tab you do the following:

#### Format text

 You can apply different styles to different sections of the text in the form. For the title, the section header(s) and the section text you can

- change the font and the font size
- use bold formatting
- align the text to the left or the centre
- assign a different color to the text and the background

#### Insert different banners for different forms

 You can assign different banners for Tell-a-friend and Unsubscribe forms. If you want to use one image for all forms, keep the **Default** option selected. Click **Upload** to add the image to the form. You can also use an image from the [Media Database](/olh/media-database.md "Admin – Media Database"). To display an image, click **View** **Image**. To remove an image from the form, click **Clear Image**. **Attention**: The width of the image for a Tell-a-friend must not exceed 620 px, that of an Unsubscribe must not exceed 520 px. Click **Save** to apply your settings. Click **Preview** to display a sample form with your settings.

#### Opt-in Invitation And Interests tab

 Here you define the opt-in invitation/opt-out request (which you activated [here](/olh/forms-data-fields.md "Forms – Data Fields")) in more detail. For this, you do the following:

1. Select a language.
2. Enter the desired text in the opt-in invitation field.
3. If required, enter an opt-out text as well. This text is displayed after a contact has clicked the unsubscribe button.
4. Create the interests. These are displayed together with the opt-in invitation, thus enabling subscribers to tell you what kind of information they are interested in. You can add and delete interests, as well as translate the term yourself; otherwise, it will be translated by the system. Click **Overview** to see a list of available translations.

 Click **Save** to save your settings.
