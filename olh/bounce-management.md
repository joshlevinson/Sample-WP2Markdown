**Admin menu -> Bounce Management The **Overview** tab displays a list of  email addresses which have produced [bounces](/olh/about-bounces.md "Admin – About Bounces").

#### Filter bounce list

 The list can be filtered for the following criteria:

- Select a Status option to show the bounce results for either **all**, **inactive** or **active** email addresses which produced bounces.
- Select a Bounce type option to display either **soft bounces**, **hard bounces** or **block bounces**.
- Select an **Email** option to view the bounce results for a particular email or all emails.

 In the Bounce list, inactive email addresses are marked with an x, while those addresses which produced bounces, but have not yet been deactivated, are marked with a ?.

#### Remove contacts

 To remove a contact from the database, click **Delete contact**.

#### View error report

 Click **Detailed view** to display a detailed error report for the selected address. You see the date and time of dispatch, the sender and the original subject of the bounced email as well as the reason why it could not be delivered. The report also contains the **Bounce body**, i.e. the error message issued by the server identifying the error (either the recipient's mail server or one of the Emarsys mail servers). If you want to export the bounces (e.g. to correct the email addresses), click **Save as list**.
