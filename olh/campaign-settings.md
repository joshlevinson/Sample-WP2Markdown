**Campaigns menu -> **Email Campaigns** -> **CMS **-> **Settings** This is where you configure the global settings of your email campaign. There are a number of mandatory and optional settings to make. In the **Settings** pane you can:

- **Name** your email
- Select the **language** for the automatic texts ([Additional features](/olh/campaigns-about-emails.md "Campaigns â&#128;&#147; About Emails")).
- Select the **Link domain** you want this campaign to use **Please note**: this feature is not visible unless enabled for your account.
- Select the **template** to use **Please note:** if you have copied an existing template-based campaign then you cannot change this.
- Define an **email category** either by choosing from an existing category using the dropdown, or entering a new category name in the field below.
- Optional: enable **text only** emails using the checkbox.
- Choose the **Recipient source** using the dropdown.
- For certain campaign types you can define whether this is a one-time or a recurring email in the **Frequency** drop-down.
- If the [Frequency Cap](/olh/frequency-cap.md "Admin â&#128;&#147; Frequency Cap Overview") has been activated in your account, you can select whether this email ignores it or not.
- There are also a number of optional features which may be enabled for your account: - **CC** - you can send a copy of your email to a specific contact list. The responses from this list will not be counted in the email analysis.
- **Exclude** contacts from this email. If you select a contact list or segment to exclude, then all those contacts will be removed from the email launch list before sending. **Please Note**: This feature is only available for ad hoc emails sent to segments and lists. It is not available for any emails used by Automation Center programs.
- **BCC** - Â This feature is restricted to three email addresses, which must all belong to the main sender domain configured for your account.

 Once you have defined the campaign settings you can then proceed to define the email preferences.
