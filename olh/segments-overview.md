**Contacts menu ->** Segments** You can create segments and run segmentation on all contacts in your database; this helps you to define target groups based on their properties (e.g. interests, locations, demographics, etc.) or their behavior (how they react to your emails). The results can be saved as contact lists and used for specific targeting in future email campaigns. The **Segments - Overview **page displays a list of all existing segments. Here you can do the following:

#### Edit segments

 Click [![refresh-icon](/assets/images/refresh-icon.png)](/assets/images/refresh-icon.png) to refresh a segment; click [![edit-icon](/assets/images/edit-icon.png)](/assets/images/edit-icon.png) to edit the conditions of the segment or **X**  to delete the segment.

#### Create segment

1. Decide to create a completely **New** segment or to **Copy** and edit an existing one.
2. Click **Create**; you are moved to the Segment Details page, where you can define the segment in detail.
