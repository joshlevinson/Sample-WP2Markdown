**Campaigns menu > **Email Campaigns** > **Content editor** If you use your own HTML code rather a Suite template to design your emails, the campaign settings, email preferences and testing utilities are the same but the content editor is different. The Suite HTML editor is a standard editor with a number of formatting options available on the toolbar. In the footer of the page you can access the Suite Online Help, as well as seeing the current size of your email (in KB).

#### Editing the text

 You can toggle between the WYSIWYG editor and the HTML source code by clicking [![toggle-code-icon](/assets/images/toggle-code-icon.png)](/assets/images/toggle-code-icon.png). You can also switch between the **HTML** and **Text** versions of the email via the corresponding tabs. To enter a link in the text version, proceed as for the HTML version. After you have inserted a URL, do not forget to add a description above the inserted URL. This also applies to links leading to registration forms and to the Additional features pages.

#### Linking text

 To insert a link underlying a word or phrase, select the text string and click **Insert Link**. This leads you to the **Insert Link** window, where you can define the link options:

1. Enter an internal link description
2. Add the link to a Link category (for analysis and segmentation)
3. Decide what type of link is required. For **Trackable links**, enter the URL in the corresponding field. From the drop-down menu you can select **http** or **https** (an SSL, Secure Socket Layer).
 
**Please note**:Â All links added this way are trackable, i.e. each click on the link is counted and displayed in the email analysis. You can add as many trackable links as you want to your email. To link a text with a previously entered URL, tick **Use existing link** and select the URL from the drop-down menu. The internal link name stays the same as when you last used that link (it is after all the same URL). If you want to use the same link but a different link description, repeat the steps given above. If you want to use a Landing page, tick **Landing page** and either select one or create a new one. To insert a link to a registration or contact form, tick **Forms** and select a form from the drop-down menu. The same applies if you want to provide a Tell-a-friend or Unsubscribe feature in your email. Please note that the tell-a-friend feature forwards the entire email (not just a particular section). Every email has a so-called browser link at the top. It ensures that contacts with email clients unable to display HTML can see your emails in their browser. They see a short text followed by the link to the online version of the email. When this link is clicked (or copied and pasted into the browser) it leads the contact to your email. If you want to add this text and the link (in addition to the existing one on top of your email) to one of the sections, you must select **Online version** from the **Additional functions** drop-down menu. If you want to add a link which is not trackable, tick **Simple link** and enter the URL in the **Insert URL** field, then click **Insert**. When entering an email address, select **mailto** from the drop-down menu and enter the email address into the text-entry field, then click **Insert**.

#### Use Auto Track

 The **Auto Track** function searches for manually added hyperlinks and transforms them into trackable links. Click **Auto Track HTML** to open a window where untracked links are listed. All untracked links found in the HTML version are listed in the upper part of the window. On the left, you can decide which links are to be converted into trackable ones. You can convert all links by ticking **Select all**. **Please note**: only full hyperlinks (including the http:// prefix) are listed. All untracked hyperlinks found in the text version are listed in the lower part of the window. Click **Track** to start converting. When you use the Auto Track function frequently, the links you tracked before are not listed again. If you are unsure about a link, click **View Link Placement**. This opens a preview of the current section where each listed link is highlighted and identifiable by a number next to it (the same numbers as in the **Auto Track** window). Tick **Check for trackable links** on save, if you want the system to automatically search for links not yet tracked each time you save.
