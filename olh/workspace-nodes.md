**Campaigns menu -> **Automation Center** -> **Workspace** Here you have a breakdown of all the workspace nodes available, along with a breakdown on what they all are and how they work. For practical examples of how they can be put to use, please see the **Blueprints** section which contains examples of program blueprints.

 This Icon is added to the node of your program where the participation settings are applied. You can click on it to open the participation settings menu and change the settings using this icon. **Please Note**: This is not an actual node in itself, but is an icon that is added to a node.</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">[![ac-node-example1](/assets/images/ac-node-example1.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-example1.png)</td> </tr><tr><td>[![reporting-icon](/assets/images/reporting-icon.png)](/assets/images/reporting-icon.png)</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">**Reporting Icon**

 This Icon is added to each email node in your program and allows quick access to the analysis page for that particular campaign. **Please Note**: This is not an actual node in itself, but is an icon that is added to a node</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">[![ac-node-example2](/assets/images/ac-node-example2.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-example2.png)</td> </tr><tr><td>[![ac-node-on-form-submit](/assets/images/ac-node-on-form-submit.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-on-form-submit.png)</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">**Form**

 This node allows your contacts to enter the program once they complete and submit the selected form. **Please Note**: Only general registration forms can be selected and used here. **Important**:Â A form already in use by another program will not be available for selection.</td> </tr><tr><td>[![ac-node-on-data-change](/assets/images/ac-node-on-data-change.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-on-data-change.png)</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">**Data change**

 Here you can select an action based on a change to a specific data field (e.g. email address). When a contact Â makes a change that matches the field, it causes them to enter the program. You can select system and custom fields here, with the only exception that certain fields which are filled in only once, such as 'Date of First Registration', or dynamic fields like 'Age', cannot be used. Field values can be changed in many ways through data import, API call, manual change, and so on. **Please Note**: If a form is submitted containing field values that already exist, these will not be overwritten and the program will not be triggered. Only a change in the field value triggers the program, regardless of how it is changed.</td> </tr><tr><td>[![ac-node-new-contact](/assets/images/ac-node-new-contact.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-new-contact.png)</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">**New Contact**

 This will add all new contacts in the account database to the program, regardless of how they were registered. **Important**: If there is another active program which new contacts could enter, e.g. a registration form, there is no check to stop them from entering this program as well.</td> </tr><tr><td>[![ac-node-external-event](/assets/images/ac-node-external-event.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-external-event.png)</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">**External Event**

 Here contacts can enter a program if they are returned by an API call containing the same external event. **Please Note:** To use this node you must first have created an API call using the **External** **Events** pages of the Administration menu.</td> </tr><tr><td>[![ac-node-abandoned-cart-green](/assets/images/ac-node-abandoned-cart-green.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-abandoned-cart-green.png)</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">**Abandoned shopping cart**

 Entry points for contacts who have added content to a shopping cart on your eCommerce site, but did not complete the purchase. **Please Note**: Only available to Ecommerce Tracking users</td> </tr><tr><td>[![ac-node-recipients-filter](/assets/images/ac-node-recipients-filter.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-recipients-filter.png)</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">**Target Segment**

 In this node you select a target segment to enter the program, which can be used as a starting point for an ad hoc batch program that goes through further actions before sending the email. When the program is activated, the segment will refresh and all the relevant contacts then proceed to the next step in the process. **Please Note**: You can only choose an existing Suite or Smart Insight segment here.</td> </tr><tr><td>[![ac-node-recurring-filter](/assets/images/ac-node-recurring-filter.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-recurring-filter.png)</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">**Recurring filter**

 This node combines a recurring schedule and a Filter. At the scheduled time, the filter will run and all contacts returned will enter the program. For more information on segmentation please see the **Filter** section further down. **Please Note**: Users can schedule this once per day as the shortest interval, if schedules need to be more frequent then this must be done via Emarsys Support.</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">[![ac-node-recurring-filter-shortcut](/assets/images/ac-node-recurring-filter-shortcut.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-recurring-filter-shortcut.png)</td> </tr><tr><td>[![ac-node-mass-email](/assets/images/ac-node-mass-email.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-mass-email.png)</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">**Batch email**

 Here you can combine a **Target Segment** and an **Email**. When the program becomes active, the segment will refresh and the email will be launched.</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">[![ac-node-batch-email-shortcut](/assets/images/ac-node-batch-email-shortcut.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-batch-email-shortcut.png)</td> </tr><tr><td>[![ac-node-recurring-mass-email](/assets/images/ac-node-recurring-mass-email.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-recurring-mass-email.png)</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">**Recurring batch email**

 A combination of recurring schedule, **Target Segment** and **Email** which means that at the defined time your selected segment is refreshed and the email is launched.For further information please see the **Send email** and **Filter** sections below.</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">[![ac-node-recurring-batch-email-shortcut](/assets/images/ac-node-recurring-batch-email-shortcut.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-recurring-batch-email-shortcut.png)</td> </tr><tr><td>[![ac-node-birthday](/assets/images/ac-node-birthday.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-birthday.png)</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">**Anniversary**

 A combination of a **Target Segment** and a **Quick filter**. The filter displays all the date fields in you database along with the corresponding criteria (e.g. Is in the future, Is today, Is in the past, etc.).</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">[![ac-node-anniversary-shortcut](/assets/images/ac-node-anniversary-shortcut.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-anniversary-shortcut.png)</td> </tr><tr><td>[![ac-node-didnt-open-email](/assets/images/ac-node-didnt-open-email.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-didnt-open-email.png)</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">**Didnâ&#128;&#153;t respond to email**

 This node is a combination of **Wait** and a behavior filter which allows you to take action if a certain criteria has not been met after a time limit that you set. The behavior filter automatically references the email previous to it.</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">[![ac-node-didnt-respond-shortcut](/assets/images/ac-node-didnt-respond-shortcut.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-didnt-respond-shortcut.png)</td> </tr><tr><td>[![ac-node-didnt-click-link](/assets/images/ac-node-didnt-click-link.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-didnt-click-link.png)</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">**Didnâ&#128;&#153;t click link**

 This node combines **Wait** and a behavior filter e.g. if after X time if a user did not click a link in the email then progress to the next stage. When you use this node you need to chose from a list of links, which are taken from the email preceding this node. **Please Note**: Only trackable links and landing pages are shown. Add-ons and forms are currently not available for selection.</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">[![ac-node-didnt-click-shortcut](/assets/images/ac-node-didnt-click-shortcut.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-didnt-click-shortcut.png)</td> </tr><tr><td>[![ac-node-abandoned-cart-red](/assets/images/ac-node-abandoned-cart-red.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-abandoned-cart-red.png)</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">**Abandoned shopping cart**

 This node handles contacts who have added items to a shopping cart but did not complete the purchase. **Please Note**: Only available to eCommerce Tracking users</td> </tr><tr><td>[![ac-node-send-email](/assets/images/ac-node-send-email.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-send-email.png)</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">**Send email**

 In this node you select an email which will then launch according to the preceding nodes and program schedule. The email itself can be previewed or edited through opening the properties pop-up. If you open an email from a program, the program name is displayed at the top and you can return to the program via the linked program name at the top. **Please Note**: Emails which are not of the type â&#128;&#152;On program eventâ&#128;&#153; are also available for selection, but they will lose their recipient source and scheduling page once selected.</td> </tr><tr><td>[![ac-node-wait](/assets/images/ac-node-wait.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-wait.png)</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">**Wait**

 Here you specify a delay in either hours or days before the next step is taken in the program. **Important**: Delays specified in days are counted as calendar days, not 24-hour units. If you specify 'wait 1 day and send at 07:00' the node will collect content that happens between midnight and midnight which is then sent out at 07:00 the following day.</td> </tr><tr><td>[![ac-node-scheduled](/assets/images/ac-node-scheduled.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-scheduled.png)</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">**Schedule**

 Here you specify a fixed time and date in the future when the next step is run in the program.</td> </tr><tr><td>[![ac-node-exclusion-filter](/assets/images/ac-node-exclusion-filter.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-exclusion-filter.png)</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">**Exclude**

 Whereas the **Segment** node only allows contact in the selected segment to proceed, this discards any contacts in the segment. In this way you can ensure that contacts have not already received an email which appears later in the program, for example.</td> </tr><tr><td>[![ac-node-filter](/assets/images/ac-node-filter.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-filter.png)</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">**Segment**

 Here you select segments which can be used as simple logic switches that allow you to split paths according to contact properties or responses. In order to use this node you have to have an existing Suite or Smart Insight segment that you can apply it to. You can link filters by either having them in parallel (OR function) or in sequence (AND function). Parallel filters means that contacts can progress along two paths if the filters have been configured.Sequential filters means that only contacts have to meet the requirement of each filter to progress, if in any point in the sequence they do not fulfil a criteria they exit the program. **Please Note**: All contacts who are returned by the segment go to the next step of the program, those who are not are assumed to have exited the programs.</td> </tr><tr><td>[![ac-node-simple-filter](/assets/images/ac-node-simple-filter.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-simple-filter.png)</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">**Quick filter**

 Whereas the **Segment** node requires you to select an existing Suite or Smart insight segment, the Quick filter lets you choose a field and a value on the fly. This is a useful and time-saving way to fine-tune your program.</td> </tr><tr><td>[![ac-node-filter-switch](/assets/images/ac-node-filter-switch.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-filter-switch.png)</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">**Filter Switch**

 This node lets you add an existing segment to the path, which will allow contacts to proceed if they are in the segment, and exclude them if not.</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">[![ac-node-switch-yes-no](/assets/images/ac-node-switch-yes-no.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-switch-yes-no.png)</td> </tr><tr><td>[![ac-node-ab-test](/assets/images/ac-node-ab-test.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-ab-test.png)</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">**A/B Splitter**

 Here you can split the program into different paths, with contacts randomly assigned to each path according to a % value that you set. You can add paths and change the % value while the program is active. However, you cannot delete a path once a contact has entered it. To stop further contacts entering a path, simply reduce the % value to 0.</td> </tr><tr><td>[![ac-node-sms](/assets/images/ac-node-sms.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-sms.png)</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">**Send SMS Message**

 Triggers an SMS message to be sent whenever a contact reaches this node. **Please Note**: Only available to SMS Campaign users</td> </tr><tr><td>[![ac-node-finish](/assets/images/ac-node-finish.png)](/assets/images/ac-node-finish.png)</td> <td style="padding-left: 10px">**End path**

 This is how you end your program, and all paths in a program require this as the final node. This node signifies that all contacts who reach it have exited the program.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>**
