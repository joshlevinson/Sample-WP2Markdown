**Forms menu >** Data Fields ** On the **Data** **Fields** page, you create and arrange the fields in your form. The fields you create are also written to the Emarsys eMarketing Suite database; this makes all the corresponding information available throughout the system, e.g. for personalization or filtering.

#### Add fields

 To add an existing field to the form, go to **Available** **fields**, select a field on the left and clickÂ [![r-arrows](/assets/images/r-arrows.png)](/assets/images/r-arrows.png) ; to remove a field from the form, click [![l-arrows](/assets/images/l-arrows.png)](/assets/images/l-arrows.png). Existing custom fields can be edited [![edit-icon](/assets/images/edit-icon.png)](/assets/images/edit-icon.png) or deleted [![Ico_delete](/assets/images/Ico_delete.jpg)](/assets/images/Ico_delete.jpg). System fields cannot be modified. To create a new field, click [![create-field](/assets/images/create-field.png)](/assets/images/create-field.png); this opens the Field Editor. If you use more than one field in the form, separate them by inserting a **Page Break**. You can also create **Sections** in your form. To change the sequence of fields, page breaks and sections, select them in the list and use [![down-arrow](/assets/images/down-arrow.png)](/assets/images/down-arrow.png) and [![up-arrow](/assets/images/up-arrow.png)](/assets/images/up-arrow.png).

#### Define mandatory fields

 Select a field in the list and click [![mandatory-field](/assets/images/mandatory-field.png)](/assets/images/mandatory-field.png). In the form, the field name is displayed with a red star to indicate that it must be filled in.

#### Include opt-in invitation

 You can display or hide the opt-in invitation in the form; if you want to offer an opt-in invitation, you can narrow it down to individual newsletters. You can also decide if the check box for the opt-in is to be ticked by default. Click **Save** to save your settings.
