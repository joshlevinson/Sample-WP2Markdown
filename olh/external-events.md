**Admin menu ->** External Events** On the **Overview** page, you can see all the external events which are available for use as entry points in the [Automation Center](/olh/ac-overview.md "Campaigns – Automation Center – Overview"). Each external event can be linked to an API call to add contacts to programs.

#### Using external events in programs

 To add contacts to a program via the eMarketing Suite API, proceed as follows:

1. Create a new external event on this page.
2. Create a program with the entry point **External Event** and select the appropriate source from the list.
3. Set up the desired API call and, using the appropriate interface, retrieve the external event name from the list

 Once the API call has been set up, and the program launched, all contacts returned by the API call will automatically be added to the program. You cannot edit an external event name, but you can delete it using the** X** at the end of the row and then create a new one with the correct name. **Attention**: For this function to be available, you must have the Emarsys eMarketing Suite API integrated. For more information, please contact Emarsys Support.
