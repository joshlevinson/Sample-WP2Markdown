**Admin** menu ->** Email Archive** In Emarsys eMarketing Suite, an email archive is defined as a custom list of emails. You can create any number of email archives; they come as a link which you can embed in your website or other emails. For email archiving, each account in Emarsys eMarketing Suite has a designated dummy contact assigned, which will automatically be addressed in the archived email ("Dear Mr Mustermann"). This guarantees the protection of your customer data. Email archives can be set up with three different kinds of links: - via link to an individual email (such as the latest edition only)
- via auto-archive (see below)
- via RSS feed

#### Auto-archive

 This function generates a link which adds the email to an existing group of emails (e.g. all newsletters sent this year) #### What are RSS Feeds?

 RSS is a platform-independent web format based on XML. It was developed for the web exchange of news and other web contents. The abbreviation RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication (originally Rich Site Summary or RDF Site Summary). Unlike HTML pages, RSS data is created logically and without any additional design and layout elements. As a user of an RSS reader, you can read RSS data and track changes on a website. RSS data can also be processed via  PHP, ASP or other script languages. This way, the contents of  web pages, intranets or desktop software can be displayed and read as required.
