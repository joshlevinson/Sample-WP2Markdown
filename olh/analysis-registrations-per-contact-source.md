**Analysis menu** ->** Registrations** ->** Per Contact Source** To see where the different contacts are being generated you use the dropdown menu **Sources** of database entry and then a date range from the right using either **Date Range** or **Custom Date** **Range**. This allows you to see how the contacts evolve over time from the different sources.
