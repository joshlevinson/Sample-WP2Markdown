**Campaigns menu -> **Email Campaigns** -> **Create/Edit Campaign** When you create a new template-based email you are first asked to select the template on which it is based. After that you are taken to the Suite content management system (CMS).

#### The CMS interface

 The Suite CMS opens with two panes visible. On the left is a list of all the available section groups in the template, and on the right is a dynamic preview pane. As you add content to the email, it will become visible in this pane. The CMS also has a toolbar above, which contains a number of campaign-level features. These are:

- **To Email List** - this takes you back to the [Email Overview](/olh/email-campaigns-overview.md "Campaigns â&#128;&#147; Email Campaigns â&#128;&#147; Overview") page.
- The** campaign name and version** are also displayed in the middle of the toolbar.
- **Save** - saves your change and displays a Validation pop-up in the lower right corner which lists all the settings which still need to be defined before the email can be launched.
- **Settings** - this opens the **Campaign** **Settings** dialog where you can define the campaign language, change the template, define the recipient source, etc.
- **Versions** - here you can create new email versions for A/B split testing
- **Testing** - here you can send testmails and generate full HTML previews (including all personalization variables), as well as access the [Inbox preview](/olh/inbox-preview.md "Campaigns â&#128;&#147; Inbox Preview") feature.
- **Schedule** - here you find all the controls for scheduling and launching the campaign.

 In the footer of the page you can access the Suite Online Help, as well as seeing the current size of your email (in KB).
