**Contacts menu -> **Data Import** Here you can **manually** **import** a file, check the status of any **Current** **Imports** and view your **Import** **History**. Please note: All data is imported into Suite in .CSV format. In order to avoid errors, you must [pay attention to the settings](/Resources/csv-files.md "CSV Guidelines") you use for your import file.

#### Current Import Status

 In this table you can see the status of any active imports. You can abort an import before it is finished, but any contacts already imported will remain in your database. More than one import can run at the same time, but only one per Suite user. Once an import is finished, it will move from this table to the **Import History** table.

#### Import History

 In this table you can see a list of all your previous imports. You can also see how many new contacts were created, how many potential duplicates were identified, and how many confirmed duplicates were merged with existing contacts.

#### Manual Imports

 Click Import to start the new [Import Wizard](/olh/import-wizard.md "Contacts – Data Import – Import Wizard"), which will guide you through the import preparation with on-screen prompts. Please note: Before you start an import, make sure that the fields in the import file all exist in the database – if not you can use the **Field Mapping** feature to map them to existing fields, or use the [Field Editor](/olh/field-editor.md "Admin – Field Editor Overview") to create them.
