**Navigation = Analysis > Registrations** Here you can see all **online** **registrations**, **imported** **contacts** and **manually** **entered** **contacts** as they were added over time. In the top left under **Overview** it tells you the total number of contacts as well as when the last update was. The view defaults to the current month, but you can select different dates by using the **Date** **Range** or **Custom** **Date** **Range** on the right. To see what contacts make up the graph simply click on the **Show** **Contacts** button in the top left hand corner which gives you a list of the **current states of the database** as a whole. Â
