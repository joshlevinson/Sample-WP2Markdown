**Admin menu ->** Email Archive** On the **Overview** page you can link to archived emails or create customized summaries.

#### View archived emails

 The list displays all emails which were created in Emarsys eMarketing Suite; it has the following elements:

- **URL** - clicking here displays the link to an email; it can be copied and embedded in your website or in another email.
- **Campaign** - displays the email name. Click an entry to view detailed information on the email. Click [![edit-icon](/assets/images/edit-icon.png)](/assets/images/edit-icon.png) if you want to archive the email under a different name.
- **Sent to / upon** - here you can see if the recipient source for the email was a segment/list or a registration form.
- **Status** - the status of the email; options: **In Design, Ready to Launch, Tested, Launched, Not Launched**.
- **Language** - the language of the email.
- **Sent** - the send date. To adapt it, click the calendar icon.
- **Auto-archive** - click this option to generate a link which adds the email to an existing group of email (e.g. all newsletters sent this year)

 The emails in the list can be filtered for their **Archive status**, their general **Status**, and their language. The default archive status of all emails is **deactivated**.

#### Create email archive

 To create an archive (i.e. a list of emails), do the following:

1. In the list, go to the **Auto-archive** column and **activate** all emails you want to include in the archive.
2. In the **Settings** section of the page, you define your archive in more detail: Select **all emails** to include all emails. Select **all emails sent to a list or segment** to include emails which use either a filter or a segment as their recipient source. Alternatively, you can include only emails belonging to a specific newsletter.
3. Select an **email language**.
4. For **Design**, keep the **Default** option, which lists all selected emails. For other options to be available, you need an archive template; contact your Account Manager for more information.
5. Click **Create Archive** to generate the corresponding link.
6. The **Auto-archive links** section displays the link you have just created, as well as the link to the latest email in the archive. With the [RSS feed](/olh/email-archive.md "Admin Ã¢&#128;&#147; Email Archive Overview") option you can feed your email archive using your own archive template (PHP or ASP).
