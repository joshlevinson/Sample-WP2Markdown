**Campaigns menu -> **Automation Center** -> **Program Summary** Currently the only reporting available is the **Program Summary**.

#### Program Summary

 On this page you get an overview of the Program with a clear snapshot of how well the campaign is performing. Above each node in the blueprint you have two numbers indicating contacts in and contacts out. These figures will depend on how you have configured the node, e.g. an entry point may be governed by the participation settings. An email may be limited by a [Frequency cap](/olh/frequency-cap.md "Admin Ã¢&#128;&#147; Frequency Cap Overview"), etc. Here you can identify the effectiveness of the campaign and identify areas where further attention might be needed.
