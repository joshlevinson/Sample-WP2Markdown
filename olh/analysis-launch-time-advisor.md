**Analysis** menu ->** Launch Time Advisor** Here you can choose when to launch your email campaigns by looking at the response habits of the recipients in your database; for that you use the graphs to optimize your timing. You can show the data based on days of the week as well as hours during the day to ensure that your email is sent at the most appropriate time for the contacts to open it. The graph shows the percentage of recipients who have opened an email and then clicked in it, and the results are generated from all emails sent from your account to a launch list of over 200 contacts; the result is updated once a week. For statistical relevance, hourly periods where fewer than 20 opens occurred are ignored.
