**Forms menu >** Source Code** On the **Source** **Code** page, you find code information which helps you to link the current form to your website. With the code available on this page you can do the following:

#### Have the display of registration forms triggered by the action of a contact

 Go to **Hyperlink** section of the page, copy the link information and place it into the source code of your website. Via a text link, e.g. "Sign up for our newsletter!", or a dedicated button you can lead the contact to a registration pop-up window and thus link your website to the registration form you have created.

#### Display registration forms when a certain page is loaded

 Go to the** On load pop-up window** section of the page, copy the link information and add it to the body tag of the desired page. When the page is loaded, a pop-up window with the registration form is displayed.

#### Use a prefill mechanism

 This mechanism can be activated by using two different methods:

1. PHP: for web servers supporting PHP. This is the recommended method, as it also works with browsers which do not support JavaScript or have it deactivated for security reasons.
2. JavaScript: for web servers supporting HTML only.

 For more information, please contact Emarsys support.

#### Use form source code to design custom registration forms

 If you want to use a form with custom layout, use the code specified in the **Form** **Source** **Code** field as a basis. This code has no formatting; you can integrate it in your page and adapt the layout as desired. **Attention**: The form uses the fields of the form you created in Emarsys eMarketing Suite. Any changes to these fields should first be made in Emarsys eMarketing Suite; then the source code can be added once again to your website.

#### Prefill a static form with customer info from the database

 Attach the parameters in the fourth field of the page to prefill a form with contact data. For more information, please contact Emarsys support.

#### Use background registration

 Use the code from this field if your existing forms are connected to your own database and you want to have the contact information transferred to the Emarsys eMarketing Suite database as well. For this, you have to compare the registration variables (name, last name, email) in your existing form with the ones available in your Emarsys eMarketing Suite account. Fields which do not exist in your account [must be created](/olh/forms-data-fields.md "Forms â€“ Data Fields"). For more information, please contact Emarsys support.
