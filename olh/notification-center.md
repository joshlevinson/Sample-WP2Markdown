The Notification Center is a new feature designed to act as an inbox within Suite, enabling messages to be sent to users, and can be displayed using the new bell icon next to the Log out button: [![icon_bell](/assets/images/ico_bell.png)](/assets/images/ico_bell.png) The Notification Center can send various levels of notifications including:

- **Users only** - Segment Generation information, only visible to users who initiated the segment generation.
- **Account-wide** - Import (Auto and Manual) notifications for the whole account.
- **System-wide** - Corporate notifications, visible to all users.

 To begin with the Notification Center will only display **important** messages, which initially only include system-wide notifications, but using the** Show more** button you can display all available messages. Messages are displayed in order of recency, with the newest at the top of the list.
