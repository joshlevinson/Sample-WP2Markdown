**Admin menu -> Internal Blacklist -> Email** The table displays all blacklisted entries with their email address, the name of the administrator who added them and the date they were added. Clicking any column header sorts the entries in ascending or descending order, based on the column you chose (e.g. email address, administrator, date added). - To add a particular email address to your Internal Blacklist, enter it in the field at the top left and click **Add Email**.
- If you have a list with many addresses to add to the Internal Blacklist, you can upload it. Lists can be either TXT or CSV format and make sure the email addresses are in the first column. **Important**: If the addresses are not in the first column, then the import will not add any of them to the blacklist.
- You can export your blacklisted entries by clicking the **Export** button, and then entering the desired email address to send the content in the prompt.
- If you want to remove a single entry, check the box next to it and then click **Delete**. To remove all entries on the page click **Select all** and then **Delete**. To remove all email addresses from the blacklist, click **Empty Blacklist**.
- Click **Search** to look for an individual email address (you do not need to enter the full email address).
