**Admin** menu ->** Field Editor** On the **Field Editor **page, all data fields can be edited. The list displays the fields with their **Field** Name and **Field Type**. The **Created by** column displays the name of the administrator who created the field. For information on the different field types, see About Fields. #### Create fields

1. To create a new field (i.e. a custom field) click **New**. The **Field Generator **dialog box opens.
2. Enter a **Name** for the field and select a **Type** to determine the field format; then click **Create**.
 
 On the next page of the **Field** Generator, you define your field in more detail: - Click **Edit** to change the **Name** of the field, the **Call for action**, and the **Attributes** directly in the Field Generator.
- If you want to provide the field in other languages, select a Language from the drop-down list and enter the translated terms for **Name**, **Call for action** and the **Attributes** directly in the Field Generator; then click **Save**. By re-selecting languages from the list, you can switch between languages and view or edit the terms you have defined for them.
- You can decide to place the field name in the form either **left of choice** or **above**.
- For fields of the type **Single choice** and **Multiple choice **you can define attributes. Enter the number of attributes and click **Create**. Enter the required attributes and click **Save**. The field attributes are displayed and can be edited.
- Click **X** to remove an attribute; define the attribute order by using the arrow icons. If you select either a-z (or z-a) and click **Apply order**, the attributes are displayed in alphabetical order or vice versa.
- You can edit the JavaScript; click **Show javascript** to display an editable field with the corresponding properties. Clicking **Hide javascript** will hide the JavaScript entry field.
 
 For date-entry fields and URL fields, there is a pre-set standard code available; this code can be adapted. **Attention**: Unless you are very familiar with JavaScript, please do not change the JavaScript standard code yourself, but first contact Emarsys Support. A possible use case for editing JavaScript would be the limitation of options for a multiple-choice field, so that a contact who wants to register via a form can choose only a limited amount of options, for example 5, in a multiple-choice field which actually contains 20 options (e.g. Your favorite flight destinations). You must save your settings before closing the Field Generator; otherwise your changes will be lost.
