For example, if you are importing a contact into the database and the same person has already subscribed to your newsletter (through an online registration form) but has entered a different email address, you will have two profiles for one person, and the recipient would receive two of the same emails from your next email campaign.

The system recognizes identical duplicates and merges them into one single set of data, either through default handling (by matching first name, last name and email address) or custom handling (user specified fields).
