**Campaigns** menu ->** Email Campaigns** -> **CMS** -> **Section editor** You can add placeholders to your email content which will then be replaced by dynamic text when the email is launched or previewed. There are two options: #### Personalization

 Personalization variables are an easy way to include personal contact data in your email. Wherever you see this icon you can select from a list of database fields and add a placeholder to the text. The placeholder will be displayed in the form: $FieldName$. When the email is sent to a contact, or a full campaign testmail is created, the corresponding value for this field will be substituted instead. In this way you can personalize your content by using the contact's real name, address,etc. #### Conditional Text

 Conditional text is a more flexible way to personalize your emails. This adds placeholders which will substitute text defined by you, according to filter conditions. In this way you can have one subject line for women and one for men, or different text in different languages, etc. Â The placeholder will be displayed in the form: $COND_RuleName$.
