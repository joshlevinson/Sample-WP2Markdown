**Dashboard** menu ->** Quickstart Center** The Quickstart Center is designed to provide new users of Emarsys eMarketing Suite with an easy introduction to the application. All the functionality that is necessary to launch an email campaign successfully is presented in three columns: - Preparing for your Email Campaign
- Creating your Email Campaign
- After the Launch
 
 By following the links in the columns you will be taken through the process of preparing, launching and analyzing an email campaign. The essential actions that you need to perform are displayed in the top half of each column, with advanced features for enhancing your email campaigns listed below. When you open a page via the Quickstart Center, you see a button in the bottom right corner which enables you to return to the Quickstart Center immediately. This button is not displayed if you open a page normally (i.e. from a navigation menu). For some actions, you will be asked to select an email campaign first. If you want to create an email campaign based on an existing email campaign, you can select from a list of all the email campaigns in your system. If you want to view the results of a specific email campaign, you can select from a list of all launched email campaigns (including deleted ones).
