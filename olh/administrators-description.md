**Admin menu -> **Administrators** -> **Description** On the **Description** page you define the properties of a new user.

#### Set user properties

 Here you do the following:

1. Assign a custom **User name** or keep the one assigned by the system.
2. Enter a valid **Email address** for the user.
3. To create a password for system login, click **Change Password**, enter and confirm the password and define its period of validity, then click **Save**.
 
**Please note**: The password must have a minimum of eight characters and contain both letters and numbers.

<div> <table><tbody><tr><td>**Important**:</td> <td>Emarsys does everything it can to protect your login credentials, such as preventing browsers from saving passwords. However, some browser versions override this and will store credentials unless the user explicitly switches off this setting. Please bear this in mind when considering login security for users of your account.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>1. Assign an **Access level**.
2. Select **Interface Language**; this specifies the interface (GUI) language for the user.
3. With the **Default language for forms** option, you assign the default language for creating [forms](/olh/forms-overview.md "Forms – Overview"), [fields](/olh/forms-data-fields.md "Forms – Data Fields") and [users](/olh/administrators-overview.md "Admin – Administrators Overview").

 Please note that for emails, the language will still have to be selected each time an email is created.

1. In the **Time Zone** field you select the time zone in which all times displayed in the GUI are expressed (unless explicitly shown otherwise, e.g. with a specific GMT offset). This setting overwrites the account default time zone.

 The following information is optional:

1. Select a **Title**.
2. Enter a **First name**.
3. Enter a **Last name**.
4. Enter the **job position**.
 
**Note**: The **Mobile Phone** field is read-only and shows the mobile phone number  which is used for SMS authentication, if  this feature is enabled. Click **Save** to save your settings. Click **Back** to return to the [Overview](/olh/administrators-overview.md "Admin – Administrators Overview") page.
