**Dashboard menu** ** The Dashboard is the default home page for Emarsys eMarketing Suite. It provides you with an at-a-glance overview of the status of your contact database and email campaigns. It is divided into three sections:

- Database Status
- Database Growth History
- Email Campaign Status

#### Database Status

 This section shows you how many contacts there are in your database, broken down into the following figures:

- **Total Contacts** - this is the number of individual entries in the database, including duplicates that have not yet been merged and other invalid contacts.
- **no opt-in** - (including opt-outs) - this is the number of contacts who have not yet subscribed to (or who have explicitly opted-out of) mailings.
- **no email address** - this is the number of contacts whose email field is empty or misspelled (e.g. no '@' or an unrecognized domain).
- **invalid email address** (as per Bounce settings) - this is the number of contacts who have returned undelivered mails, and then been flagged as bounced according to the Bounce Settings you have defined. Click Bounce settings to open the Bounce Management page directly.
- **available contacts** - this is the maximum number of contacts who can currently receive emails from you.

 Please note that a contact may have opted out and also failed to give a proper email address, and will therefore be counted in the 'no email address' and 'invalid permission' categories. For this reason the detailed figures will not necessarily add up to the total contacts in the database, especially for larger databases. The **Database Status** section is updated automatically once a day, but can be manually updated at any time via the **Update results** link.

#### Database Growth History

 This section shows you how many contacts have been added to your database during the specified time period. You can define the time period via the drop-down box in the top-right corner. The figures displayed in the graph and the table below are cumulative. That is, they represent the running total of all the contacts added to the database in this time, regardless of their status. If the number of contacts is reduced by deletion of invalid entries or by duplication handling, the figures in this section will not be affected. **Note**: The exact number of contacts is given in the box at the top of the blue slider. You can toggle this function on and off by clicking it with the mouse. The table below the graph gives a more detailed breakdown of the added contacts. **Sources** The Sources tab shows which contacts were added via list import, registration forms and manual entry. You can remove the imported contacts by activating the **Omit imports** checkbox. **Top Forms** The **Top Forms** tab lists the three most commonly used registration forms, along with the number of contacts added via these forms. **Last Emails Launched** This tab lists the last emails you have sent, with the planned number of emails and sending progress. Bounce, open and click rates are also given. For more detailed information, click [![view_details_icon](/assets/images/view_details_icon.png)](/assets/images/view_details_icon.png) on the right. Click **To Reports & Analysis** to open the **Email Overview** page and see the full list of all launched email campaigns. **Note**: On-event email campaigns are not listed here. **Last Emails Edited** This tab lists the last email campaigns which have been modified. The **Recipients** column shows the intended recipients of the email, as defined in the **Email Settings**, **Recipient Source** section. To open the **Settings** page for an email, clickÂ [![edit-icon](/assets/images/edit-icon.png)](/assets/images/edit-icon.png) on the right. **Note**: On-event emails and emails that have already been launched are not listed here. **Last On-Event Emails** This tab lists the last on-event emails which have been launched. To edit an emails, click [![edit-icon](/assets/images/edit-icon.png)](/assets/images/edit-icon.png) on the right. To see the results of the email, click [![view_details_icon](/assets/images/view_details_icon.png)](/assets/images/view_details_icon.png) on the right. You can also see the full list of emails by clicking **View all On-Event Emails**. **Note**: If a user opens the Dashboard on a workstation with no Flash Player installed (or an out-dated version), they will be prompted to download the latest version.
