**Forms menu -> **Overview**

#### General Registration form

 This type is used to generate a form you can use for any kind of registration. General Registration forms come with an optional login feature (see below) which can identify registered contacts via one or more fields before directing them to a form or web page.

#### Newsletter Registration form

 This type generates a registration form for a newsletter.

#### Change Profile form

 With a Change Profile form, contacts can update their personal data. The form you create here serves as an alternative to the standard form used by Emarsys eMarketing Suite, which cannot be changed, i.e. fields cannot be removed, added or renamed. If you want to use other fields for updating contact data, we recommend creating a special form as specified in this book.

#### Contact Us form

 This type is used to generate a form for a contact request. If you decide to create a Contact Us form, the Forms tab menu is extended with a Recipients page. On the corresponding page you can create recipients, specify individual responsibilities and provide the corresponding email addresses. On the [Data Fields](/olh/forms-data-fields.md "Forms – Data Fields") page you can select an opt-in invitation from another form and include it in the Contact Us. On the [Source Code](/olh/forms-source-code.md "Forms – HTML Source Code") page, an individual link is created for every recipient you add. You can copy the link and place it in the source code of your page (e.g. the support page). If a contact clicks the link, they go directly to the form of the designated recipient. In doing this, you avoid having an additional page where the contact must make yet another selection.

#### Form templates

 All form types except Contact Us forms can be created via form templates. To integrate such a form template into your account, you must provide Emarsys with detailed design specifications. For the additional functionalities coming with this feature, see [Form Templates](/olh/form-templates.md "Forms – Form Templates"). For more information, please contact your Account Manager.

#### Login feature

 The login feature can be activated on the [Form Description](/olh/forms-description.md "Forms – Description") page; it assists you in the following:

- You can provide registered contacts with an opportunity to update their profiles via your website. A contact's login data is unique; as soon as contacts have been identified they can access the actual form and update their data.
- If your customer data is incomplete (e.g. there are email addresses missing) you can encourage your customers to provide information via offline promotions. Via a login form on your website each contact is identified by unique criteria; duplicates are avoided.
- You can protect sensitive areas on your website. In this case, the login form authorizes a registered contact to enter such an area.
