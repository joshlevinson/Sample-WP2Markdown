**Campaigns** menu ->** Email Campaigns** ->** Inbox Preview** On this page, you can test an email campaign, to see how it will be displayed in the inboxes of the most popular email and webmail clients. If tests have already been run for an email campaign, the thumbnails of the most recent test are displayed. You can display the thumbnails from previous tests by selecting the test in the drop-down box. If no test has been run, you see a series of dummy thumbnails. #### Run a test

 To run a test, click **Run Test** (or **Run New Test**). A dialog box is displayed listing all the available mail clients. Select the clients you want to generate test screenshots for and click **Run Test** (or **Run New Test**) again. **Please Note**: The email campaign must be ready for being tested, i.e. must have a template attached, as well as a valid recipient source and a subject line defined. Once a test has begun, it can take some time until all the screenshots for all selected clients are generated. However, since the process runs in the background, you can work in another part of the application and return to the **Inbox Preview** later. Depending on your internet browser, you may also have to refresh in order to see the finished thumbnails. #### View screenshots

 To view the screenshots of your test, click the thumbnail of a mail client. This opens the Viewer page where four versions of the email can be seen: - **Inbox (images)** – This is how the email will appear in the classic tri-pane inbox layout, with part of the mail body visible in the preview section. The option to display images has been activated.
- **Inbox (no images)** – As above, but without the option to display images activated.
- **Full screen (images)** – This is how the mail will appear once the recipient has opened it in their mail client. The option to display images has been activated.
- **Full screen (no images)** - As above, but without the option to display images activated.
 
 Depending on your screen resolution, the screenshots might be displayed in a reduced size. Click a screenshot to see it in full size. In the **Viewer** page, you can switch between different clients via the drop-down box above. You can also stay with the same clients but switch between different tests via the other drop-down box. #### Save screenshots

 The images generated in these tests are stored on the Emarsys Server for one year, after which they are deleted. If you want to copy a screenshot, e.g. for a presentation, use your internet browser’s **Copy image** function in the right mouse-click menu. This copies the screenshot to your clipboard and you can paste it into another application.
