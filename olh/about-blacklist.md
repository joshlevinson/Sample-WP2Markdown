#### <span class="f_Subheading1">What happens in case of email complaints?</span>

 If a contact complains about an email they received from you, Emarsys automatically blocks their email address from your account. These email addresses remain blocked even if the contact is deleted and re-imported. The number of complaints for each email is listed on the corresponding [Results Summary](/olh/analysis-results-summary.md "Analysis Ã¢&#128;&#147; Results Summary") page. As email complaints can have a negative effect on your company's reputation, Emarsys recommends (and enables by default) the blocking of contacts who have complained about emails sent by other Emarsys customers.
