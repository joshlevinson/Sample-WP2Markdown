**Campaigns menu -> **Email Campaigns** -> **CMS ** The sections pane of the CMS shows all the available section groups in your template. These are listed in the order in which they would appear in the email.

#### Managing sections

 To create a section, click the plus sign next to the section group name. This will open a row for the section as well as updating the preview pane accordingly. Each section row has three icons:

- [![mobile-sense-desktop](/assets/images/mobile-sense-desktop.png)](/assets/images/mobile-sense-desktop.png) / [![mobile-sense-mobile](/assets/images/mobile-sense-mobile.png)](/assets/images/mobile-sense-mobile.png)- this is a toggle switch which defined whether or not the section will be visible on mobile devices. Please note that this is only available is the template is enabled for [Mobile Sense](/Suite/mobile-sense.md "Mobile Sense").
- [![copy-icon](/assets/images/copy-icon.png)](/assets/images/copy-icon.png)- this copies the section
- [![delete-icon](/assets/images/delete-icon.png)](/assets/images/delete-icon.png)Â - this deletes the section

 In addition, you can re-order sections within a group by clicking the three horizontal lines on the left and dragging the row up or down in the list. Every time you make a change on the left, the dynamic preview on the right will refresh to help you visualize the progress.

#### Editing sections

 To edit the content of a section, click the section row to open the section editor. Here you have a list of options on the left which will display their corresponding editor controls. **Please note**: Not every section group will support all these features, and in these cases the content will simply not display in the preview pane. It may also be that some of the available formatting options in the text fields are also not supported by the template.

<div> <table><tbody><tr><td>**Header**

 </td> <td>The section header is a text-only field and is presented as a WYSIWYG editor with a limited set of formatting options. These are represented by standard icons with tool tips available.</td> </tr><tr><td>**Body**

 </td> <td>The body of the section is where most of the text will appear. The editor here has all the controls of the Header plus a few more, in particular the **Upload content** icon.</td> </tr><tr><td></td> <td>**Important note**: Both the Header and the Body editors offer the option to work directly in the HTML source code. In this mode, only a limited array of HTML tags are permitted. Suite will strip out all other tags when switching back to WYSIWYG mode, which could lead to inconsistency or even errors in your email code. The following HTML tags are permitted: - In the Header: <strong>, <b>, <em>, <i>, <u>, <del>, <s>, <strike>,Â <span>, <font>
- In the Body text: <strong>, <b>, <em>, <i>, <u>, <del>, <s>, <strike>,Â <span>, <font>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>,Â <br>, <div>, <p>, <blockquote>,Â <a>, <img>, <table>, <tbody>, <thead>, <tfoot>, <tr>, <th>, <td>
 
</td> </tr><tr><td>**Image**

 </td> <td>You can select the section image either from the Media DB, or simply paste in the URL to an image that is hosted on a web resource.If your template is enabled for Mobile Sense, you can also select another image which will display on mobiles devices.</td> </tr><tr><td>**Link**

 </td> <td>The section link is entered here, as well as the options for linking the header and image, and assigning alternative text and a title for the campaign analysis.</td> </tr><tr><td>**Registration form**

 </td> <td>Here you can add a link to a Suite registration form.</td> </tr><tr><td>**Section targeting**

 </td> <td>By default, all sections are sent to all contacts on the launch list. However, you can Â define sections to display only to contacts in a particular segment, or with specific interests.</td> </tr><tr><td>**Social networks**

 </td> <td>You can add icons to the section to share the section link with a [social network](/olh/about-social-networks.md "Campaigns â&#128;&#147; About Social Networks").</td> </tr><tr><td>**Advanced options**

 </td> <td>In the **Advanced options**, you can change the section group (i.e. move the content to another group) as well as switch the editor to Advanced Mode.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>**
