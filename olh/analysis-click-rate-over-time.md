**Analysis** menu ->** Emails** ->** Click Rate Over Time ** You can get a breakdown of the **Click** **Rate** **over** **time **both by days and hours, which you can define by using the **Date** **Range **field, or setting a **Custom** **Date** **Range** on the right hand side of the screen. The main screen will give you the quantity per date, and if you click on the date itself it will show you the times during the day that the clicks were made. This helps you to anticipate two things: - How soon can you expect clicks
- At what time do most of the clicks take place
