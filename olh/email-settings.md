**Campaigns menu -> **Email Campaigns** -> **CMS** -> **Email Settings** As well as defining campaign-level settings, you can also define certain preferences for the email content. These will apply only to the email content itself and, if you are using multiple versions, only to the open version. In this way you can test different subject lines, headers, etc. In the Preferences pane you have the following information and controls:

#### Sender information

 Here you specify the sender information your recipients will see. Proceed as follows:

- Enter a **From (name)**, e.g. your name or the company name.
- Enter a **From (email address)**. This is obligatory information,  for the following reasons: - Most ISPs (Internet Service Providers) do not forward emails lacking a reply mail address
- Some subscribers might want to write a response email instead of using our [additional features](/olh/campaigns-about-emails.md "Campaigns – About Emails").

**Please Note**: Emarsys eMarketing Suite can handle reply emails according to your needs. To enable this feature, you must first create the reply mail address in the [Reply Management](/olh/about-reply-management.md "Admin – About Reply Management") page and then select it here using the last icon.

- Enter a Subject line. The text you enter here is displayed in the Subject column of a recipient's email program. To view how the text will be displayed in the various email clients, click Subject Checker.

#### Define email header

 In the Email header field you can enter an email headline (e.g. My Company Newsletter | Issue October 2012). Even if the HTML version of your template does not have a headline (e.g. because you use a picture with an integrated header instead) we recommend to add an email header; it will be useful in the text version of the email. All of the above content can be personalized ( ) as well as subjected to conditional text (). For more information, see [Personalization and Conditional Text](/olh/personalization.md "Campaigns – Personalisation and Conditional Text").

#### Additional Features

 Here you can choose from a list of additional features to include in the email, as well as enable the [Social Network sharing](/olh/about-social-networks.md "Campaigns – About Social Networks") feature. Once you have finished with your preferences you can click **Sections** to open the section pane and start to add content.
