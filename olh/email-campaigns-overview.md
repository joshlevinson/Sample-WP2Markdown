**Campaigns menu ->** Email Campaigns** ->** Overview** The **Overview** page displays all the email campaigns created with Emarsys eMarketing Suite.

#### Filter existing emails

 To view only a certain type of emails, you can filter the list. The following filter options are available:

- **Emails** - Select **All** to display all emails in the system; this is the default setting. Select **Mine** to display only emails which were created by you.
- **Email category** - Filter for a certain category. Email categories can be created as required; they are assigned as part of the [Email Settings](/Suite/email-settings.md "Email Settings").
- **Status** - The status of an email is defined by a) it being active or inactive (i.e. deleted), and b) its current life cycle phase. From the first drop-down box, select **current** to display all emails currently available in the system. Select **deleted** to display all emails which have been deleted (for information on how to restore deleted emails, see below). From the second drop-down menu, select a phase. **Please** **Note**: If your account has a large number of active campaigns, you may want to select the current (last 200) option to improve the speed with which the page loads.
- **Language** - Select a language to display only emails which were created with a certain language setting.
- **Show child emails** - Activate this check box to display both emails and their child emails. **Note**: A child email is derived from an existing email. Both on-event and recurring emails can have child emails.

#### View existing emails

 Emails are listed with their **Email name**, **Email type**, i.e. which recipient source/contact list they used, and their **Status**. The user who created the email is listed under **Responsibility**. You can also view the date they were **Created** and last **Changed**. Emails can be sorted by clicking the respective column title. You can look for a particular email campaign using the **Search** function at the bottom of the left pane by selecting** in email campaigns** in the dropdown. The icons to the left of each email indicate whether it was created via templateÂ [![template-email-icon](/assets/images/template-email-icon.png)](/assets/images/template-email-icon.png) or custom HTML source code [![custom-html-icon](/assets/images/custom-html-icon.png)](/assets/images/custom-html-icon.png). The icons on the right of each row allow you to view, edit or delete an email. **Please Note**: Only the user who created an email can delete or edit it.

#### View and restore deleted emails

 When you click [![Ico_delete](/assets/images/Ico_delete.jpg)](/assets/images/Ico_delete.jpg), emails are not deleted, but moved to a different folder. If the deleted email has already been launched, very little changes for its recipients; the only differences are that additional features are no longer live, and that deleted emails are not listed in the [Email Analysis](/olh/analysis-emails-overview.md "Analysis â&#128;&#147; Emails â&#128;&#147; Overview"). To view a list of deleted emails, select **deleted** from the **Status** drop-down list. To undo deletion, click [![icon_restore](/assets/images/icon_restore.png)](/assets/images/icon_restore.png). If you restore emails which were not launched before deletion, their status will be the same as before. If a launched email is restored (i.e. an email which was launched and deleted before all emails were sent), its status changes to **paused**.

#### Save your Overview page settings

 If you want to save your filter settings, activate the **Save settings** checkbox. The next time you return to the **Email Campaigns - Overview** page, it will open with your settings.

#### Create email

 In the bottom half of the **Overview** page you can decide how you want to create your email using one of three options:

- **Create template-based emails (email CMS)**: with this option you must first select the template before proceeding to the CMS interface.
- **Use custom HTML source code**: this option takes you to the email Settings page where you can enter the email properties (in the same way as on the Campaign Settings screen) before proceeding to the content editor.
- **Copy an existing email**: this option takes you directly to the CMS interface where you can start working on the content.
