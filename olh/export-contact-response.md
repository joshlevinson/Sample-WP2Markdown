**Contacts menu ->** Data Export** ->** Contact Response** On the** Contact Response** page, you make settings for the export of response information - i.e. clicks - and schedule an automatic export.

#### Define settings for a manual export of contact response

 For a detailed description of the settings you can make on the **Export Contact Response (Clicks)** page, see [Settings for a manual export of data changes](/olh/export-data-changes.md "Contacts – Data Export – Data Changes"). In addition, you specify one or more Sources, i.e. the form or email type that triggered the click.

#### Schedule automatic export of contact response

 On the **Export Scheduler** tab, you define settings for the automatic export. For this, you must use a so-called export rule. Existing export rules can be edited, deleted, activated and deactivated. To create a new export rule, click **New Rule**; the **Edit Rule** page opens. For the settings you can make, see [Settings for a manual export of data changes](/olh/export-data-changes.md "Contacts – Data Export – Data Changes").
