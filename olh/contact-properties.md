**Contacts menu ->** Add Contact** ->** Properties**

#### Adding contacts manually

 If you go to the **Contacts** tab and select **Add Contact**, you are moved to the **Contact Properties** page. For each new contact, five tabs are available: **General**, **Personal**, **Company**, **Other** and **Communications**. Enter the contact information as required.

#### View field history

 Via the **History** link you can view the changes made to a field. Originally, this was developed to track changes in the opt-in and multi opt-in fields. If a field has been changed, either manually or by an administrator, duplication handling or online via a registration form, the **History** link is displayed next to it. Click the link to see what has changed. **Date/time** shows when changes were made. **Value** shows which entry has replaced the original one. If the box is empty, the previous value was replaced by a zero-entry field. **Source/Admin** shows you how/by whom the change was made:

- **Admin** -Â  Changes were made manually by the Administrator.
- **Import** -Â  Changes are due to an import.
- **Duplication Handling** - Changes result from a manual merge via duplication handling.
- **Form** - Changes are due to a registered contact who subscribed again via one of your registration forms. The source "form" is only displayed if the contact re-registered with the same key data (first, last name and email address) and has thereby changed one field value.

 In the **IP** column you can see the IP address of the PC on which the changes via registration form were made. Emarsys is bound by legal requirements to record and display this address.

#### View communications

 The **Communications** tab lists all **incoming** and **outgoing** messages (e.g. newsletters, promotion emails) between you and a contact. To filter the messages by outgoing or incoming date, activate the corresponding option. You can also view the name of the **Email campaign**, the **Email type** (promotion, newsletter or on-event), the **Recipient** (for incoming contact requests) and the email **Subject line**; all these columns can be sorted alphabetically.

#### View and add remarks

 You can enter individual notes on a contact. This way, all communication information (e.g. phone calls, meetings) can be tracked. All existing notes are displayed with their creation date, subject line, author and change date. You can rearrange the notes by clicking the corresponding column header. Click **Show all** to see an overview of all notes. Remarks can be viewed, edited or deleted. Click **Preview** to display a window with the selected remark; click **Edit** to change the subject line and/or the text of the remark. To undo your changes, click **Reset**. To finish your editing, click **Save**.<a name="search"></a>

#### Search for existing contacts

 On the **Properties** page, go to the **Search** section at the bottom. Select a suitable search option from the drop-down menu. Enter the contact information and click [![view_details_icon](/assets/images/view_details_icon.png)](/assets/images/view_details_icon.png). You are moved to the [Search Results](/olh/search-results.md "Contacts â&#128;&#147; Add Contact â&#128;&#147; Search Results") page.
