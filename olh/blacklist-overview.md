**Admin menu ->** Internal Blacklist** [Email complaints](/olh/about-blacklist.md "Admin – About the Internal Blacklist") trigger an automated process, in which Emarsys blocks the corresponding addresses from your account. Via Internal Blacklist you can manually specify additional email addresses or domains which will always be excluded from your mailings. On the **Overview** page, you can decide if you want to block recipients who have complained about **other** Emarsys customers. This is the recommended option, and the default setting. If you do not want to block these recipients, deactivate the check box on this page. On the **email** page you can add [email addresses](/olh/about-blacklist.md "Admin – About the Internal Blacklist") to your blacklist, individually or import them in larger numbers. You also have the option to export your blacklisted entries so that you can import them to another sub-domain and exclude them there as well. On the **domain** page you can exclude entire [domains](/olh/blacklist-domain.md "Admin – Internal Blacklist – Domain") from receiving your emails by adding them to the blacklist. On the other tabs, you can exclude either individual  or  from receiving your emails.
