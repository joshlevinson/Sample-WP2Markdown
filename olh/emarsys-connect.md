**Admin** menu ->** Emarsys Connect** On the **Overview** page you can see all the third party integrations available to use in Suite. If you are using one of the applications listed here, contact your account manager for details on how to set up the integration. Details on how to set up, and work with, each integration is available on request in separate documentation. Some integrations offer a test facility, or sandbox, which you can use for testing purposes before linking the live integration with Suite. This is indicated by a checkbox which you must activate before setting up the integration. **Please Note**: in order for these integrations to work, you must have API access (which Emarsys Support will create for you) and a field called ExternalId, which you must create yourself.
