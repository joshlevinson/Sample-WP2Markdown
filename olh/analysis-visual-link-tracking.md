**Analysis menu ->** Emails** ->** Visual Link Tracking** Here you can view a copy of your email with indications on the message itself of which links on the message generated the clicks from best to worst performing. The legend in the top right above the message indicates the ratings from **Best** (green) to **Average** (Orange) to **Worst** (Red). Visual Link Tracking works for both test and final launches, but for email campaigns with multiple launches with the + in front of it, it will not work just like the [Individual Link Tracking](/olh/analysis-individual-link-tracking.md "Analysis Ã¢&#128;&#147; Individual Link Tracking").
