**1.3 Type of messages and when to include Unsubscribe options** SMS messages fall into either of the following categories: - **Transactional SMS Messages**
 
 No opt-out information is required as these messages contain static information, e.g. system notifications, password retrievals, ignore opt-out features or other important updates. - **Commercial/Marketing SMS Messages**
 
 A contact has explicitly requested to receive recurring updates from you by opting in, and needs to be provided with a simple and easy way to stop these messages i.e. opt-out. The unsubscribe using our unique short link is the perfect solution for such messages. Please note: As with email, you cannot use numbers who have opted in for one purpose (e.g. system updates) to send them other types of content (e.g. marketing content); you need to have explicit opt-ins for each type of content. ### **Is there a limitation on the number of contacts per campaign?**
