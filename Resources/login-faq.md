- Using the right credentials. Remember that your password is case sensitive, and that some browsers or password managers might automatically enter the wrong information for you.
- Using the correct URL to log in. Emarsys hosts multiple Suite environments and you will only be able to log in to the one which hosts your account.<a name="concurrent"></a>

This feature allows you to specify IP addresses which do not require two-factor authentication. The IP address you are using currently is not on this whitelist, therefore you need to verify your identity by entering the code we sent to the mobile phone number associated with your user.

This feature allows you to specify IP addresses which do not require two-factor authentication.

You are attempting to log in from an unauthorized IP address, but we do not have a mobile phone number or email address to send the authentication code to. Please log in from an authorized IP address, or contact Emarsys Support to enable two-factor authentication for your user account.

Please contact Emarsys Support in order to reactivate it.**</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left; border-color: #fff; background-color: #fff; color: #555555;">One possible cause of this is account inactivity. For security reasons, Emarsys regularly disables accounts which show no recent activity. It is not possible to log in until someone manually activates your account. Currently this is done by Emarsys Support. Please contact Emarsys Support to resolve this issue.

 <a name="locked1"></a></td> </tr></tbody><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left;">**This account has had too many failed login attempts lately; as a security measure, it has been temporarily locked for X minutes.**</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left; border-color: #fff; background-color: #fff; color: #555555;">Suite allows only a certain number of failed attempts to enter the correct password. If this number is exceeded, your user account is locked for a defined period of time, after which you will be able to log in again with your correct password. The default setting is 5 failed attempts which result in a 10-minute lock-out, but this can be customized and the exact configuration depends on your user and account settings.

This lock will be automatically lifted once the specified time elapses.**</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left; border-color: #fff; background-color: #fff; color: #555555;">As a protection against 'brute force' password-guessing attacks, your account has been temporary locked. Once the lock-out period has expired you will be able to log in again with your correct password. Please contact Emarsys Support if you need to to unlock the account before the lock-out period expires.
