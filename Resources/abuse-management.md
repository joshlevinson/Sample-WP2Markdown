Emarsys Deliverability Abuse Management
---------------------------------------

 Emarsys is the engine behind some of the world’s smartest customer engagement solutions, with over 1200 clients in 140 countries using our technology, including industry leaders such as eBay, ToysRUs, Canon, Zalando Lounge, Sky and A.S. Watson. We segment and analyze 1 billion customer records and send more than 7 billion personalized emails every month. With such high traffic, abuse complaints do occasionally arise. Although we strive to prevent this, when they do happen we deal with them as quickly and efficiently as possible. Ensuring that only permission-based content is sent is our highest priority. This is why we work so hard to make sure that only the right content is sent to contacts who are happy to receive this content.

Filing an Abuse Report
----------------------

 If you have received an email that you did not request, we would like to hear about it immediately. Please take a moment to fill out the form below, making sure to include the full email header. To get a copy of the email header you will need to have a copy of the email and then use the following instructions.

### Viewing Email Headers

 Viewing the header information differs from client to client. Below are instructions for some of the most commonly-used clients and ISPs. All of these instructions assume that:

1. Your email client is open
2. You have a copy of the email

 If you have deleted the email then you may need to restore it from the trash before you can view the headers. **Important:** If you forward the email it will affect the header, so you have to get the header from the original email you received.

Our Abuse Report Handling Process
---------------------------------

 Sending as much mail as we do, abuse complaints are an unfortunate reality that inevitably happen from time to time. When someone reports an email as abuse, we take this very seriously and any of our clients about whom we receive complaints are subject to a full internal assessment. Each complaint is automatically treated as an unsubscribe request for the originating address (i.e. the recipient who complained). We do not tolerate any further sending to addresses that have complained about the client in question. Furthermore, recipients can request to be added to our discard patterns, which means that no content can ever be received from any of Emarsys clients using Suite.

Proactive Prevention & Active Abuse Complaint Handling
------------------------------------------------------

- Our expert Deliverability Team at HQ is on hand to guide our clients from setup through to providing on-going support by applying expert industry knowledge, built up from years of co-operation with ISPs, regulatory bodies and recipients. Our focus is on the end recipients of our clients' content, since optimal deliverability performance is only possible with high recipient satisfaction.
- Abuse prevention is best taken care of during onboarding. As part of the account setup process, each of our customers has their current deliverability practices assessed and is given guidance regarding compliance with regulatory requirements, industry best practices and our own high standards.
- Emarsys Deliverability HQ proactively monitors the performance of our clients to quickly identify and address any potential abuse issues before they escalate.
- Emarsys eMarketing Suite has built discard patterns that exclude suspicious recipient address patterns from your launch list. We also offer several list hygiene functions, which process bounces and unsubscribes automatically, thus helping to keep your sending sender reputation safe. Please note that these mechanisms alone do not mean that our clients are safe from abuse claims.
- All complaints are acted on instantly as we have a zero tolerance policy against SPAM or any similar violations of our policy guidelines.
- We work closely with leading ISPs and industry regulatory bodies across the globe to ensure that our clients get only the very best advice. This has been formalized into our [Deliverability Policy Requirements](/Resources/policy-requirements.md "Deliverability Policy Requirements") which are designed to explain the key factors to keep in mind and why they matter.

Ongoing Education and Support Provision

 As the industry evolves, and new legislation develops, we keep our ears to the ground and filter through all of this to provide the most relevant updates in our blogs. Whether you are a seasoned deliverability guru or a beginner, our blogs present the information you need in an easily understandable format.
