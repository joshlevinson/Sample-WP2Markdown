### What is so different about a mobile-optimized template?

 When adapting a Suite template for Mobile Sense, certain design elements of the email are selected for adaptation to mobile clients. These features are part of the template and cannot be edited by the user. They are based on the Emarsys best practice design and coding standards. Below is a list of the template elements that are most likely to be adapted for Mobile Sense and the reasons for this. Below is an example of how a section of an email might be reformatted by Mobile Sense:

<div class="row">[![mobile-sense-example](/assets/images/2015/03/mobile-sense-example.png)](/assets/images/2015/03/mobile-sense-example.png)</div>##### Font size

 Small font sizes that are good for the desktop will not work well for mobiles, since users will need to zoom in so they can comfortably read the content (for example, Apple recommends 17-22 pixels for mobile screens). The Mobile Sense template will ensure that desktops will display small font sizes and mobiles will display a larger, more appropriate font.

##### Vertical layout

 Due to the prevalence of wide-screen monitors, desktop emails typically use a 'landscape' page orientation: two, three or even four column layouts work well, as do images with text beside them. With mobile email the story is very different: the orientation should be vertical ('portrait'), with one content item per section. This means putting text below images and rearranging multiple columns underneath each other. The Mobile Sense template automatically makes this switch for you.

##### Bigger calls to action

 You will want to make it easier to click the links within the email and track those links. Small text links that work well for a desktop user with a mouse will not work for a mobile users browsing with their finger. Mobile Sense automatically converts the main section text link into a button with bigger target area. Links that are within the section (as part of the body text) will remain as text links and will not throw the mobile email off balance with buttons appearing in the middle of the text.

##### Padding

 Similarly, when buttons are close to each other in an email, it is not an issue for desktop users. For mobile devices, extra padding is added to ensure that the user does not accidentally press the wrong one.

##### Scaling

 Email do not always scale properly on mobile devices; Mobile Sense makes sure that the email is opened at full scale on smaller screens.

##### Ergonomics

 Many mobile users hold their mobiles in their right hand and use their right thumb to navigate and click. Mobile Sense therefore aligns all text to the left, and avoids placing buttons close to the bottom right corner.

##### Hide side bars and navigation bars

 In desktop emails you can have side bars with different content and links similar to those you have on your website. Top navigation bars with links can also serve a purpose: you want to catch your recipientsâ€™ eye with some variety. On mobile devices these elements will not work since they take up too much space, their links will be too small, and line breaks can disrupt both links and buttons. The responsive design should hide these sections from mobile users and display them for desktop users. At the very least, responsive design should change a six-item navigation bar to a simpler three-item one, or convert them to an entirely vertical layout.
