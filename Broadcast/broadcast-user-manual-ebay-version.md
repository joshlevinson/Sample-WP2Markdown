Introduction
------------

 Welcome to Emarsys Broadcast, the email marketing solution for high-volume senders. Emarsys Broadcast can process large amounts of data in record time; you can, for example, import 5 million email addresses in 10 minutes or display the response (open rates, click-throughs, etc.) of a 15 million-email campaign in real time. The current launch speed of 10 million emails per hour can be manually altered to accommodate slower website response times. Emarsys Broadcast is designed for virtually unlimited list sizes. With Emarsys Broadcast, you can personalize and individualize your emails to tailor them to the needs at hand; for each customer, individual images and links can be used. The application and user interface of Emarsys Broadcast were designed by marketers for marketers and do not require any prior IT knowledge. This user guide provides you with detailed information on what you can do with Emarsys Broadcast – and how to do it.

Campaigns Tab
-------------

 After you have logged in to Emarsys Broadcast, you see your user name (**1**), your account (**2**), and a direct link to your user profile (**3**) displayed at the very top of the main window. [![Brd mnl-006-006.jpg](/assets/images/2014/09/Brd_mnl-006-006.jpg)](/assets/images/2014/09/Brd_mnl-006-006.jpg) By default, Emarsys Broadcast opens with the **Campaigns** tab; here you can view, edit or delete existing campaigns and create new campaigns. A number of pre-defined, selectable campaign attributes allow you to tailor your campaigns to the needs at hand. The **Campaigns** tab consists of the following elements:

- A campaigns table with a list of all existing campaigns. The property columns provide information on the campaign attributes; by clicking one of the characters in the **Options** column, you can start to work directly on the corresponding campaign.

- The **Campaign Selection** panel; here you can search for a specific campaign and filter the campaigns in the table.

- The **Create New Campaign** button; click it to create a new campaign.

#### Define a reply address

 Go to **From and Reply** and select an email address from the dropdown list. In the outgoing email, this address is displayed as the sender's address; it is the only address a reply email can be sent to.

<table border="0" cellpadding="1" class="wikitable" style="width: 100%; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;"><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left; border-color: #fff; background-color: #fff; color: #eb5a19;">**Please Note:**</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left; border-color: #fff; background-color: #fff; color: #555555;">To define a new reply address, go to the **Administration** tab and select **Senders**.

2. If required, you can now personalize the subject line (**1**): 1. Click **Personalization** to insert more detailed recipient data e.g. a title, first name, last name, etc. The variables which will be entered in the **Subject Line** field are the column headers you have matched to the imported data during import; they are prefixed and suffixed with a double dollar sign, e.g. *$$Title$$*, *$$Last_name$$*, etc.
2. Click **Cond. Text** (Conditional Text) to define conditions that will help you to adjust the text to the recipient at hand. See *Conditional content* below. To add a new condition, enter it manually, following this convention: ##<condition_example>##.
3. Click **Save Content**.
4. You can now click **Check Subject Line** to see how the subject line is displayed in the inboxes of various email providers.

#### Add the campaign content - TEXT and HTML

 You can send your campaign as a text-only campaign or a multipart campaign (containing HTML and TEXT parts) (**3**). This enables recipients who can only accept text mails also to view your campaign. For more information, see *Create HTML content*. To define whether your campaign will be sent as text-only or multipart, make the appropriate selection on the **Campaigns settings** screen, **Email format**.

#### Create HTML content

 To create HTML content you can choose between the following two possibilities, or use a combination of them:

##### Upload your own HTML page (**2**)

 To upload your own HTML page, proceed as follows:

1. Click **Browse** next to the **Upload HTML** field and select an HTML file.
2. Go to **Encoding** and select the preferred character encoding.
3. Click **Upload Content**. The HTML editor will display the code in Source mode.

 → You can now edit the code in Source mode, or switch to WYSIWYG mode and view or work on it there.

##### Create your own content in the Broadcast HTML Editor

 Broadcast uses CK Editor, an industry-leading HTML editor which allows you to create a campaign from scratch as well as modify or update existing code. The editor opens in Source mode by default but can be switched to WYSIWYG mode if you prefer to work that way. The HTML editor applies strict HTML formatting conventions and offers a number of features including:

- Syntax highlighting
- Auto-insertion of missing closing tags
- Expanded support for CSS and Media Queries
- Modular support for adding plug ins

#### Create the text content of a campaign

 Open the **Text** tab to create a text version of the campaign. This version is displayed to recipients who can only receive text mails. You can use the **Personalization, Conditional Content, Unsubscribe** and **Links** options as they are used in the HTML version. You can also upload a text file via **Upload TEXT** or click **Get text from html** to copy text from the HTML version to the text version.

##### Upload and publish images new item

 Regardless of whether HTML is uploaded or created in the HTML editor, all image URLs included in the email's HTML version must be a reference to an image placed in a local folder on your computer. Every campaign requires a two-step process to display images correctly in the final version of your email: After uploading or creating the HTML click on "Upload Images" on the top right of the edit campaign screen. You will be prompted to browse your computer and select all image files needed for the campaign. A pop-up window will let you know once the upload is completed.

- Click **Publish Images** →The images are transferred from the Emarsys server to eBay's server where they will be hosted for the duration of the campaign.
- As soon as all images are visible in the preview the process is finished.
 
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" class="wikitable" style="width: 100%; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;"><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left; border-color: #fff; background-color: #fff; color: #eb5a19;">**Please Note:**</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left; border-color: #fff; background-color: #fff; color: #555555;">Plan some extra time in your campaign creation process, since syncing between the servers might take up to 30 minutes for campaigns with many images.</td></tr></tbody></table>#### Create versions

 You can create different versions of a campaign (**8**) and send them to small percentages of the launch list. Later you can schedule the final campaign with the version which, according to the values displayed for **Uniq.Op./Total** (open rate) and **Uniq.Cl./Total** (click rate) on the **Reports** tab, has performed the best. To create a version, do the following:

1. Click the plus sign (+) next to **Content Versions** to expand the section.
2. Insert a name for the current version.
3. Insert a name for the new version.
4. Click **Create Version**. You can now switch between the two versions by clicking

The **Campaign Settings** screen is displayed with the campaign settings of the aborted campaign.

### Advanced Features

#### Create multi-segment campaigns

 In a multi-segment campaign you can have various segments, i.e. single campaigns, which can be created, edited and launched individually, to adapt and customize their content to the requirements at hand. A multi-segment campaign consists of a parent campaign that contains one or more child campaigns. You can view the statistics for each single segment (child campaign), as well as the overall statistics for all child campaigns together (parent campaign). To create a multi-segment campaign, do the following:

1. In the **Campaign Settings** screen, click **Create Multi-segment Campaign**.
2. Enter the required number of segments into the **Add** field and click **Create** to display the **Segments Overview**.
3. In the **Name** field of the overview, enter names for the segments. A segment name can consist of numbers and/or characters; special characters are not allowed. The combination of campaign name and segment name is limited to a maximum of 18 characters.
4. Click **Create Campaign**. Every segment is displayed with a separate S (Settings) option.
5. Click **S** to go to the **Campaign Settings** screen, where you can make individual settings for each campaign segment.

#### Recurring campaigns

 A recurring campaign can be scheduled to run multiple times at a specific frequency (e.g. once a day, once a week/month, several times a week/month, etc.) using the same settings and content. Manual overrides for single recurrences are also possible: With the release of Broadcast V4.9.0 a set of new features for working with recurring campaigns was introduced (see below for further information). It is now possible to:

##### Creating a Recurring Campaign

 To create a recurring campaign, do the following:

- In the **Campaign Settings** screen, create a campaign. See *Creating a campaign*.
- For the **Campaign Type**, select **recurring**.
- Click **Save Settings**.

 Once the campaign has been defined in the system, you can import recipient data. Recipient data is defined in a CSV file and is sent via web client or over an SCP connection to our systems. We call the use of the web client a manual import and the transfer via SCP an automatic import.

##### Setting up an Automatic Import

###### Preparation

 Once the campaign has been defined in the system, you can import recipient data. Recipient data is defined in a CSV file and is sent via a web client or over an SCP connection to our systems. We call the use of the web client a *manual import* and the transfer via SCP an *automatic import*. The manual import process is not described in this document.

###### Setting up an Automatic import

 For each file to be imported automatically, proceed as follows:

- Use the file naming format described in the next section.
- Add a header row that allows columns to be mapped to system fields (this is described below).
- Use a consistent delimiter for all files. Tabs are used by default; contact Broadcast support if you require a different format.
- Avoid using text qualifiers, such as single or double quotation marks.
- Transfer the file via SCP to a single directory based on your account. Once the file is transferred, create an empty control file using the same name of the import file, plus the extension .ctl.

 We have an email-based notification system for import errors. If an import fails, you can use manual import, for example to select failed files and to restart the process.

 For ad-hoc campaigns, the format of the file name should be: `[EXTERNAL_ID]-[CAMPAIGN_NAME]-[PROFILE_NAME]-[CREATED_TIME].csv` For recurring campaigns, the file format will include the recurrence date: `[EXTERNAL_ID]-[CAMPAIGN_NAME]-[PROFILE_NAME]-[CREATED_TIME]-[SCHEDULED_TIME].csv` The different parts of the file name are:

-------------------

 Use the **Conditional content** option to define conditions that will help you specify the text, according to the personal data of the recipient. For example you can define a condition that shows the text *The world belongs to women* in case the recipient is a woman, *The world belongs to men* in case the recipient is a man, or *the world belongs to everyone* in case the gender of the recipient in unknown.

### Conditional Content screen

[![Brd mnl-022-033.jpg](/assets/images/2014/09/Brd_mnl-022-033.jpg)](/assets/images/2014/09/Brd_mnl-022-033.jpg) To use conditional text in the subject line click **Cond. Text** (**1**). To use conditional text in the editor click **Conditional Content** (**2**). In both cases the following screen appears: [![Brd mnl-022-034.jpg](/assets/images/2014/09/Brd_mnl-022-034.jpg)](/assets/images/2014/09/Brd_mnl-022-034.jpg) Click **Add** (**1**) to create the condition.

The names of conditions can only contain alphanumeric characters (letters and digits). Spaces or special characters (e.g. @#$ %^&*) are not allowed. Click **Create** (**1**); the condition name will be displayed in the overview screen. [![Brd mnl-023-037.jpg](/assets/images/2014/09/Brd_mnl-023-037.jpg)](/assets/images/2014/09/Brd_mnl-023-037.jpg) Click the name of the condition (**1**) to edit it.

### Working with conditions

 On the overview screen for conditional content, you can do the following:

1. Click **Add** (**1**) to define your condition.
2. Click **Upload** (**2**) to upload HTML or text content; it will be displayed as defined by the condition.

 After you double-clicked a row in the **Reports** tab main view, the following screen is displayed: [![Brd mnl-027-049.jpg](/assets/images/2014/09/Brd_mnl-027-049.jpg)](/assets/images/2014/09/Brd_mnl-027-049.jpg) The top section of the screen displays general information on the campaign, for example the campaign name and email subject line, the destination time zone, the date/time when the campaign was sent and the user who sent it. The left pane of the screen displays the following information:

#### Email planned

 This is the number of recipients for which the campaign was scheduled; the information is taken from the **Campaigns** tab, **Scheduling** screen. You can also view the number and percentage of invalid emails. **Invalid** are all emails which do not have a proper email address assigned. Possible reasons for this could be that the email address is missing altogether (i.e. was not entered in the import file), or the email address was written with bad syntax (for example: example@@@emarsys.com, or emarsys.example.com, etc.).

#### Email sent

 This is the number of emails (expressed as an absolute value and a percentage) which had valid addresses assigned and were therefore sent by the system. Sent emails can be bounced. Bounced emails did not reach their destination, i.e. the recipient's inbox, due to a negative (or lack of positive) response from the mail server to which they had been sent. Bounced emails are differentiated in the following way:

- **Soft Bounce** - Emails which were not delivered due to a temporary problem. The reasons for this can vary, for example the recipient's inbox is full, or the domain does not exist (e.g. example@doesnotexist.com), and therefore mail servers did not return a negative response.
- **Hard Bounce** - Emails which were not delivered due to a permanent problem. The reasons for this can also vary, for example a user no longer exists in an existing domain. In this case, a negative response was returned by the server.
- **Block Bounce** - Emails which were not delivered because the mail server refused to accept them.

#### Email delivered

 This is the number and percentage of emails which have actually arrived at the inboxes of the recipients, i.e. the sent emails minus the bounces. You can also view information on the following:

- **Total Opened** - How many times emails were opened, once or several times, by their recipients. If, for example, one recipient opens one email 10 times, and another recipient opens it 5 times, the **Total Opened** value is 15.
- The **Total Opened** value can only be calculated for HTML emails and not for text emails.
- **Unique Opened** - How many individual recipients opened the email. In the example above, if one recipient opens one email 10 times, and another recipient opens it 5 times, the **Unique Opened** value for that email is 2.
- **Totals Clickrate** - How many times links were clicked. If, for example, one recipient clicks a link 10 times, and another recipient clicks the link 5 times, the **Total Clickrate** is 15.
- **Unique Clickrate** - How many individual recipients made clicks. For example, if one recipient clicks two links a total of 10 times, and another recipient clicks one link 5 times the **Unique Clickrate** is for that email is 2.
- For the calculation of this number or percentage it is of no importance which particular link in the email was clicked. If you want to view information on the performance of individual links, go to the **Link Tracking** screen.

### Delivery report screen

 By default, the right pane displays the **Delivery Report** screen: [![Brd mnl-029-052.jpg](/assets/images/2014/09/Brd_mnl-029-052.jpg)](/assets/images/2014/09/Brd_mnl-029-052.jpg) Here you can view the start date and time of the campaign; the bar chart informs you how many kilobytes were delivered at a certain time. In our example, all data was delivered at 05:00 pm and 06:00 pm. Click an hour to view the exact sending time in minutes.

### Access profiles

 An access profile defines which attributes and associated values a user can view and select when creating a campaign. Attributes and their values are defined by the Emarsys support team according to the company requirements. On the **Campaign Settings** screen, these attributes are displayed as drop-down menus; users can select values from these menus. Depending on their access profile, each user can view and select some, but not all, of these attributes and values. Click **Access Profiles** to display the following screen: [![Brd mnl-034-063.jpg](/assets/images/2014/09/Brd_mnl-034-063.jpg)](/assets/images/2014/09/Brd_mnl-034-063.jpg) By default, the list shows all active access profiles; select an option from the drop-down menu above the list to filter the view for deleted profiles or all profiles. If your user rights permit it, you can edit (**E**) or delete (**X**) these access profiles. To create a new access profile click **Create New Access Profile**; the **Create Access Profile** screen is displayed: [![Brd mnl-034-064.jpg](/assets/images/2014/09/Brd_mnl-034-064.jpg)](/assets/images/2014/09/Brd_mnl-034-064.jpg) Here you can view all available attributes and their associated values; in our example we show the attribute *department* (**1**) and the corresponding values *testing* and *testing2* (**2**), as well as the attribute *country* and its values.

1. Assign a **Name** to the new profile. The name must start with a letter and can be followed by any other alphanumeric characters and underscore; spaces or special characters are not allowed.
2. Define a **Description** for the profile.
3. Activate the check box next to an attribute if you want users who are associated with the profile to view all values of the attribute; you can also select individual values (at least one per attribute) if only these values are to be displayed on the **Campaign Settings** screen.
4. Click **Save** to save the access profile.

### Roles

 You can define roles, i.e. sets of access rights and permissions. These sets, or roles, are then associated with individual users and determine how they can interact with the program. Click **Roles** to display the following screen: [![Brd mnl-035-066.jpg](/assets/images/2014/09/Brd_mnl-035-066.jpg)](/assets/images/2014/09/Brd_mnl-035-066.jpg) By default, the list displays the currently active roles; select an option from the dropdown menu above the list to filter the view for deleted roles or all roles. If your user rights permit it, you can edit (**E**) or delete (**X**) these access profiles. To create a new role click **Create New Role**; the **Create New Role** screen is displayed: [![Brd mnl-035-067.jpg](/assets/images/2014/09/Brd_mnl-035-067.jpg)](/assets/images/2014/09/Brd_mnl-035-067.jpg)

1. Assign a **Name** to the new role.
2. Define a **Description** for the role.
3. Activate one or more check boxes on the left to assign the corresponding rights to the new role. Select **All** to assign a right to all users in the system; click **Owner** to assign a right exclusively to the owner, for example the owner of a campaign or conditional content.
4. Click **Save** to save the role.

### Users

 Click **Users** to display the following screen: [![Brd mnl-036-069.jpg](/assets/images/2014/09/Brd_mnl-036-069.jpg)](/assets/images/2014/09/Brd_mnl-036-069.jpg) By default, the list displays the currently active users; select an option from the dropdown menu above the list to filter the view for deleted users or all users.

- Select a value for **Access**; the access profile determines which attributes and their corresponding values users can work with when they create campaigns.
- Select a **Role**; the role determines the rights of the user, e.g. the right to create campaigns or users. The combination of access profile and role defines a user's permission level. Permission levels enable you to create users for many employees in various departments without the risk that program data is changed by an unauthorized person.

- For a new user, you also need to define values for **Login**, **Name**, **Email** and **Password**. For an existing user, you can change these attributes.
- The values for **Time Zone**, **Date Format** and **Time Format** are taken from the account settings; if required, you can change them for the user at hand.

#### Password Policy

 When you create a new user account, or change an existing user’s password, ensure that it complies with the following password policy:

- Password length of at least 8 letters
- Mixed upper and lower case letters, with at least one special character or number
- There is no limitation on reusing previous passwords

### Seedlist

 A seedlist helps you to track the deliverability of your email campaigns or to send a copy of your email campaign to predefined recipients. The seedlist can be imported as a CSV file. A list which enables you to track email deliverability is usually provided by the Emarsys support team; it consists of email addresses which were set up with the most popular Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Each campaign you send is automatically also sent to the addresses in the list. By viewing how individual ISPs handle your mail, Emarsys Support monitors the deliverability of your campaigns, and can advise you on how to improve your performance.

#### Mail headers

 A mail header is the link at the very top of a campaign. Usually, the link at the top of a campaign is also the link which is clicked the most; you can personalize this link, and thus optimize its effectiveness.
