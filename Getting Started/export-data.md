 There are three kinds of data which can be exported from Suite: Â 

- **Contact lists or segments** Straightforward exports of all contacts in a list or segment, with the database fields you define
- **Changes to contact data** Any changes to fields that occur via registration or change profile forms, manual editing or duplication handling (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> via imports)
- **Contact responses** All email response data over a time period
 
 In addition to this, you can export all the response data for any given email campaign. Exports can be performed manually, or set to run automatically according to a schedule define by you. There are no limits to the number of different automated exports you can set up, and these rules can then be turned off, amended, or removed with a click of a button. The exported data can be sent via email or saved to an SFTP server. It is delivered in CSV format, with a file name containing the export properties (type, number, language, etc.) and a unique ID.
