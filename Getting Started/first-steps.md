Now that you have your Suite account set up, and have created your first users, we will take you through some decisions regarding how to manage your contact data and email content, as well help you set up and launch your first email campaign, and export the responses. Before we start, however, there are a few other tasks that take a little longer to complete, so we recommend starting with them first. These are:

#### Deliverability Compliance

 If your emails do not meet the industry standards for deliverability, it could delay the time until you are ready to send your first campaign. Below you can find our guidelines and other helpful information that will make sure your emails hit the inbox right from the start. For more information, please read the [Deliverability Compliance guidelines](/Getting%20Started/deliverability.md "Deliverability Compliance").

#### Email templates

 Suite templates are a great way to save time and effort setting up campaigns. Read all about their features and benefits, as well as a comprehensive guide to creating the right design first time. For more information, please read [About the Emarsys email templates](/Getting%20Started/templates.md "Suite Email Templates").

#### Web Extend

 If you are planning to use Emarsys Predict or Smart Insight, you'll need to implement these data-collection scripts in your web shop. This takes a couple of hours of initial effort and then a couple of weeks to collect data and build up a robust statistical model. The sooner you start, the sooner you can begin to take advantage of Predict's personalized recommendations.
