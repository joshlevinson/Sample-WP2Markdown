It looks for relationships between these items and then makes additional cross- and up-sell recommendations. [![Predict_WEBR_cart_cartpage](/assets/images/Predict_WEBR_cart_cartpage.png)](/assets/images/Predict_WEBR_cart_cartpage.png) To maximize its impact, this widget should be placed in both the cart and the checkout pages of your web shop.
