#### What is Web Extend?

 Web Extend is a data collection script that captures the activity and behavior of your contacts when they visit your website. It captures visitor data, such as which products and categories they viewed, purchased or abandoned, when they visited your site and for how long.

- If the visitor is known (for example if they have logged in, or entered your site via a tracked link in an Emarsys campaign), this information is sent every hour to a set of custom [Web Extend fields](http://emarsys.dev/getstarted/first-steps/web-extend/web-extend-fields/) in your Emarsys account.
- If the visitor is not known, it will start building an anonymous profile from scratch, until they may be identified using smart cookies and connected to a specific contact in your database.

 It also captures product data, such as which products or categories are the most popular, and which were browsed, purchased and abandoned together.

- If you are using Smart Insight, Web Extend provides the data for your customer lifecycle scoring.
- If you are using Predict, Web Extend provides the data for your predictive recommendations.
- If you are not using either of these products, this data is still saved so that when you do decide to upgrade your marketing strategy with one or both of these modules, you already have a wealth of historical data to get you off to a running start.

 This data is captured by our JavaScript snippets that need to be embedded into your website.

<table border="0" cellpadding="1" class="wikitable" style="width: 100%; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;"><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left; border-color: #fff; background-color: #fff; color: #eb5a19;">**Please Note:**</th> </tr><tr><td style="text-align: left; border-color: #fff; background-color: #fff; color: #555555;">- The JavaScript used to collect data for Web Extend is executed asynchronously, meaning that this will have no effect on the performance of your website.
- All data that is collected and stored by Web Extend is anonymous; only after it has been imported into the Emarsys database is the web behaviour associated with actual contacts.
- If you are using Web Extend in conjunction with Emarsys Predict, you should discuss your data collection policy with Emarsys Support, as the type of data collected depends greatly on the profile of your online business.<a name="multi-domain"></a>

 If your online business is international, and offers products to users in different countries and under different domains (e.g. an international mystore.com site and localized mystore.co.uk, mystore.de sites), you can set up data collection for all your localized sites under a single merchant account. This offers two advantages:

- A single Dashboard offers you an aggregated view of all recommender widgets, across all your sites
- We combine the data collection and analysis of the different sites, yielding better, faster analysis results. For example, if you open a new store in the UK, on the mystore.co.uk domain, you will be able to use behavioral data collected from your existing mystore.com site to drive recommendations for the new site until it has built up enough traffic of its own.

 At each step of this guide we have included instructions on how to enhance your standard integration to cope with localized stores. In most cases, you will be able to simply copy-paste your original integration, provided the following two conditions are met:

- itemIDs are consistent in all stores.
- the product catalogue is roughly the same in all shops.<a name="why"></a>

#### Why should you use Web Extend?

 As well as being a pre-requisite for Predict and Smart Insight, Web Extend keeps your Emarsys contact database up-to-date with what your customers are doing on your web shop. It also has an industry-leading identification algorithm which can track specific individuals across multiple devices and channels. In short, it provides you with all the data you need to send relevant content to the right people at the right time. <a name="what"></a>

#### What can Web Extend do for your business?

 Even when used on its own, the fields Web Extend updates in Emarsys can be used to trigger automated programs that:

- Catch customers who **abandoned a cart** and bring them back to complete the purchase.
- **Follow up a purchase** with a thank you, or cross-sell related items.
- Retarget customers on different channels with offers on the **products they just browsed**.

 It also provides the data for up-to-the-minute revenue reports that measure the real impact of your marketing campaigns. If you are unsure how to use Web Extend at first, the Emarsys Automation Center includes a range of useful examples under the “Website Behaviour” blueprints category which reference these fields and which can easily be applied to a wide range of scenarios.<a name="fit"></a>

#### Is your business a good fit for Web Extend?

 Web Extend is all about building learning from customer behaviour, so the businesses that benefit most are those with a large volume of traffic (<500K page views per month) and a stable product catalogue (<500 active products in structured categories). Your web shop also needs to be able to identify visitors through to the end of the session (i.e. no external check-out page), so that this data can be matched to the corresponding contact in the Emarsys database. Finally, you need dedicated product pages in order for Web Extend to collect product information, and product categories in order for Predict and Smart Insight to analyze purchase and browse behavior and create product affinities. If you are not sure your business meets the above criteria, please contact Emarsys Support.<a name="install"></a>

#### How easy is Web Extend to install and maintain?

 Very. A comprehensive [installation guide](http://cdn.scarabresearch.com/static/manual/en/index.html) will walk you through the steps needed for setup, and a number of health-check tools are available in the Emarsys to make sure the right data is being collected.
