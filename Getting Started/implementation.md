These instructions describe how to implement and validate the Web Extend data collection scripts and are written for the technical support staff of our customers. The start the integration you will need:

- A Predict Merchant ID.
- Login credentials for your Emarsys account, to access the controls on the **Predict** menu (if you are using Predict without an Emarsys account, you will be given credentials to a dedicated Predict Dashboard, which contains the same controls).

 Please contact Emarsys Support if you still require either of these. The integration of Web Extend can be broken down into two phases:

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Phase_1_-_Integrating_the_data_collection_script">Phase 1 - Integrating data collection </span>

 This step is performed by you, the customer, and takes approximately 3-4 developer hours. It involves:

- Uploading your entire product catalogue and setting up the daily updates.
- Implementing the Web Extend scripts on your website using our easy JavaScript snippets.
- Uploading any historical sales data that you already have to give our behavioral analysis a head start (this step is optional).

 From this point on, data-collection and machine-learning is continuous.

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Phase_2_-_Collecting_enough_data_to_build_the_first_statistical_models">Phase 2 - Collecting enough data to build the first statistical models</span>

 This is an inactive phase lasting 2-4 weeks, during which the scripts you integrated in Phase 1 gather behavioral data from your users. The actual time required mainly depends on site traffic volume and product catalogue size. Please note: You might want to use this phase to think about the design and placement of your Predict widgets, either on your website or in your email campaigns. Once the predictive algorithms are ready to produce meaningful recommendations, Emarsys Technical Services will inform you and you are now ready to take advantage of the Predict recommendation widgets. If you have any questions, please refer first to the [Web Extend FAQs](/Getting%20Started/faq.md "Web Extend - FAQs").
