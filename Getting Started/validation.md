Once you have implemented the Web Extend scripts into your website, and uploaded you product catalogue (and any historical data you might have available), you can sue a set of health-check tools in Emarsys to make sure that the implementation is working properly. These tools are available via the **Predict** menu in Emarsys.

#### Live Event View

 Test the integration by broswing in your web shop and clicking products. You will see the [Live Event View](/Getting%20Started/live-event-view.md) updated in real time.

#### Live Validator

 Every event collected by Web Extend is analyzed by the [Live Validator](/Uncategorized/live-validator.md) and errors are displayed here. In case of unusual behavior, suggestions for improvement are offered.

#### Product Catalog Validator

 You can check your product catalog for errors in content or syntax at any time on the [Product Catalogs](/Predict/product-catalogs.md) page.

#### Inspector Gadget

[Inspector Gadget](/Getting%20Started/inspector-gadget.md) lets you see the Web Extend Javascript commands you invoke, right in your browser!
