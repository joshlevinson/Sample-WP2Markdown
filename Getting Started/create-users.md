Once your DNS settings have been correctly configured and we have all the information that we require, a new Suite account will be created for you. You will be provided with an admin user and password. **Important:** To ensure the security of your account, your first action should be to log in with this default admin and create a new admin user for yourself. Then log out and log in again with your new user, and delete the default admin. You can now create users for all the other people who will be using Suite, and can begin to prepare your account according to your digital marketing requirements.
