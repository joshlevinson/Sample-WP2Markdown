### Using Suite templates

 The Suite email templates are a fast and efficient way for you to create great-looking and effective email campaigns. Based on your designs, these templates are created with a variety of content, ranging from hard-coded elements such as headers or footers, to standard pre-formatted sections and finally to free areas available for complex editing directly in the source code. The templates are designed within a framework which ensures your emails are displayed properly in all standard web-based, desktop and mobile mail clients. The requirements for this framework are listed in the document below. All email designs must be compliant with this document before they will be accepted by the Emarsys Web Development team.

 Before you start to think about the look and feel of your template, make sure that you are absolutely clear what the message of the email will be. This will have a knock-on effect for the rest of the decisions you make.

##### Questions to consider

- Your campaign is a direct channel from you to the inbox of your customers; does it reflect your corporate CI and represent your brand?
- Does the overall layout fit your industry sector?
- Is this a seasonal campaign (such as Christmas Sales), a one-off (such as a welcome email), or a recurring one which will need regular content changes?

### Using your own HTML code

 If you will be using your own HTML code, or have an agency which handles your email creatives, you may find these guidelines for best practices in creating emails useful:
