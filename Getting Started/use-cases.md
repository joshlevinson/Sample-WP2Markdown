Here you can find some typical use cases for the eMarketing Suite API.

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Use_Case_Groups">Use Case Groups<a name="bs-ue-jumpmark-fc64cc202f319d7945a7f204b4949994"></a></span>

 The use cases are divided into groups, covering similar actions but with increasing complexity. For example sending a 'Welcome' email without any bells and whistles is a simple use case, whereas sending a 'Welcome' email referring to a product the contact has just bought is a more complex one. We currently offer use cases covering these three activities:

- **Sending transactional emails** The aim of these use cases is to send a welcome mail to all newly-registered contacts. To trigger the email, we use an **external event** which contains information about the intended recipient. These use cases are presented in varying degrees of complexity: - [Basic Scenario: Using the email address as key](/Getting%20Started/email-address-key.md "API Use Case 1: Using the email address as key")
- [Advanced scenario: Use custom external ID as a key](/Getting%20Started/custom-external-id.md "API Use Case 2: Using a custom external ID as key")
- [Advanced scenario: Customize your email with data from external events](/Getting%20Started/customize-emails.md "API Use Case 3: Customizing your email with data from external events")
- **[Sending batch emails](/Getting%20Started/batch-emails.md "API Use Case 4: Sending batch emails")**
- **[Keeping contacts up to date](/Getting%20Started/update-contacts.md "API Use Case 5: Keeping contacts up to date")**

 If you would like to see use cases covering different marketing activities, please pass a request on to Emarsys Support, or use the contact form at the bottom of this page.
