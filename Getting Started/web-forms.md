The Suite Forms module offers simple functionality to create different kinds of forms to collect data from contacts. These forms can be used in emails, accessed via a link, or embedded directly in a web page. They are:

- **General registration form **Used to collect new contact details with general opt-in settings.

- **Newsletter registration form **Used to collect subscriptions for a specific newsletter only. Contacts registered by this form will not automatically be eligible to receive any other emails from you.

- **Change profile form **Allows existing contacts to change their properties in your Suite database.
 
 In addition to updating the database immediately these forms can also be used to trigger transactional emails.
