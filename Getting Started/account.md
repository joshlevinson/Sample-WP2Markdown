To set up a Suite account for you we need a little information about your company and your eMarketing requirements. This will ensure that we provide you with the right infrastructure to support your digital marketing needs. Please download this document, fill in all the fields and email it to Emarsys Support. As soon as we have this information we can create your Suite account.
