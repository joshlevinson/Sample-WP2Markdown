#### Using the Suite CMS

 Suite comes with an easy-to-use, intuitive content management system which lets you create great emails with little effort, based on the email templates.

 One of the main advantage of using Suite template is that you can predefine as much of the content as you like. The remainder can be added manually, or imported automatically via the API or an [RSS feed](/Suite/rss-intro.md "Automating Content with RSS Feeds"). You can also create sections that are displayed only to those recipients who have certain interests, or to a certain segment.

#### Custom HTML emails

 If you prefer to create your own emails, Suite provides an easy-to-use HTML and WYSIWYG editor. You can enter the content manually, or use the API **Create Email** method to send content automatically. Custom HTML emails do not have sections, but you can define blocks of content to send to specific recipient groups using the conditional text feature.

#### Personalizing content

 Whichever email type you use, content such as greeting, first name, last name, etc. can be personalized using the contact database fields.

#### The Suite Media Database

 Images can be hosted by you and linked directly in the text, or hosted by Emarsys int eh Suite Mwedia Databse and added directly to the email.

#### Transaction- and product-specific content

 You can also pull content from an external database, such as a web shop or product catalogue, and add it to an email via the API. for more information, please see: [Sending Transactional Emails](/Suite/txm.md "Transactional Emails in Suite").

#### Mobile Sense - responsive email design

 All emails sent by Suite can be optimized to display properly according to the screen resolution and size of the device on which they are opened. For more information, please see: [Mobile Sense End-User Guide](/assets/images/Mobile-Sense-End-User-Guide.pdf).
