The Email Recommender widgets can be used in virtually any email. However, this product can be highly effective when used in conjunction with the Suite Automation Center, since you can then control **when** and **how** to send the message, as well as **what** content to send. The Email Recommender uses the following widgets:

##### Personal

 The classic 'recommended specially for you', based on browse history and the wisdom of the crowd. First-time visitors receive the best-selling products instead.

- Aimed at driving website traffic and conversions by dramatically improving click-through-rates from emails.
- Enhance the experience by letting cusotmers discover new products they never knew they wanted.
- Fewer clicks to purchase: from email straight to product page and then to check-out.

 For use in:

- Newsletters
- Browse abandonment follow-ups: 'personally selected for you'
- Welcome emails
- Re-engagement
- Birthday emails

##### Post_purchase

 Similar to the Also_bought website recommendation widget, this is based on the last product the customer purchased and displays complementary products or products that are likely to be purchased as next purchase.

- Helps convert first-time buyers into active buyers.
- Increases customer lifetime value.
- Re-purchase reminders (i.e. when the customer is likely to run out and need a refill).

##### Abandoned

 When a cart is abandoned, this widget displays the products that we left behind. Depending on the number of products the widget can show, any remaining placeholders show complementary recommendations.

- Revenue recovery by bringing the customer back to complete the purchase.
- Fully automated - no need to think about it once it is active.
- Offer dynamic incentives based on the value of the cart.

##### Category

 Similar to **Personal**, this widget offers products within the specific category of the product they are viewing. Similar to **Personal**, this widget offers products within the specific category of the product they are viewing.

- For companies with a large and varied product catalog, direct the customer to the most relevant or profitable products within each category.
- Enhance the experience with more targeted recommendations.
- Useful for inventory management.

#### Â Our examples

- Our first example is to use the ***Mail Personal** *widget to include between four and eight recommendations in **every marketing email that you send out**, including regular newsletters.

 In addition to this, you can use the Suite Automation Center in combination with the [Web Extend database fields](http://emarsys.dev/getstarted/first-steps/web-extend/web-extend-fields/ "The Web Extend Fields in Suite") to run fully automated programs and generate extra revenue without any effort on your side. The following three programs are what we regard as the **absolute minimum** best practices to take full advantage of the Predict Email Recommender:

- [Abandoned shopping cart email campaign](/Getting%20Started/email-abandoned.md "Example 1: Abandoned Cart Campaign")
- [Post-purchase email campaign](/Getting%20Started/email-purchase.md "Example 2: Post-Purchase Campaign")
- [Abandoned browse email campaign](/Getting%20Started/email-personal.md "Example 3: Abandoned Browse Campaign")
