The ***Personal*** widget offers targeted recommendations to visitors, and should always be prominently displayed on your home page as it gives an immediate personal touch to the browsing experience by displaying items that interested the visitor during their last session.

#### Using Personal on sub-pages

 Since the ***Personal*** widget updates its recommendations with every click, you should also place it on generic pagesÂ such a category and search pages. This will ensure that the recommendations evolve with the session and adapt to the visitor's changing behavior. An ideal location is on the right side of the page, balancing the left navigation menu. If your design does not support this you can incorporate it into the body of the page, making sure that it is still clearly identified as a personal recommendation just for that visitor.
