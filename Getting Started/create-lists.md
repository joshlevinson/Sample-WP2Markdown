With the exception of transactional emails, and on-import campaigns (where the email is triggered by the import of a list), most emails in Suite are sent to contact segments. Segments can be created based on a variety of criteria, from contact properties to email response behavior. If you are using Smart Insight, you can also use Smart Insight segments as launch lists, and refine them further in the Suite **Segments** page.

#### Excluding contacts

 After you have defined your launch list, you can then choose to exclude contacts in a different segment from the campaign (for example, if they have already received a similar campaign. You can also set a frequency cap for contacts so that they do not receive too many messages within a given time frame.
